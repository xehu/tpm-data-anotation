2,t3_30uf3s,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.

4,cysac2e_1,"I totally agree. I love solving CS problems. I even get that sort of joy from reading *about* CS problems, but that doesn't mean it's easier. It just means that I enjoy working on it more, and I do have some natural aptitude for it. It also doesn't mean that I can't sit through an talk about art. They're usually pretty facile, at least the ones about Egyptian art are. In fact, the same people usually crank out the same talks every year. I could probably tell you in advance what they will be from the scholar's name and the abstract."
5,cyshwie_1,"&gt; Also, bear in mind that many art papers are difficult to read because the authors use excessive jargon and other obfuscating techniques to hide the fact that they actually have a fairly simple point to make

This isn't gibberish, you're just ignorant of the discipline and the influences and reference points of the writer. Most notably, Foucault.

(You seem like a reasonable guy, btw.) "
15,e6ciwm3_1,"&gt; I have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the Ford/Kavanaugh situation.
Potential corroborating evidence:"
16,e6ciwm3_2,"* The WaPost has seen therapist records from 2012 in which Ford discussed this assault.  This strongly demonsrates this story was not concocted to undermine Kavanaugh's SCOTUS nomination.
* Her husband was told in 2012 (this evidence is less useful, because he is a biased witness).
* One other woman at her school said the assault was talked about at the time.  Given time to investigate, more students at the school could be found.  This, again, shows that it pre-dates the time when K became important."
17,e6cjudx_2,"3. It is possible to believe that something happened to Ford but that something didn’t involve Kavanaugh. So the choices you are trying to box me into aren’t my only options.
This woman could be right. She could be misremembering. I hope we get more evidence and can settle this definitely."
18,e6clcvs_3,"It's not felonious to make a statement like this, even if untrue,  but now he has to repeat it under oath, or in effect confess that this was untrue.
&gt; It is possible to believe that something happened to Ford but that something didn’t involve Kavanaugh.
At that point, you can only be arguing mistaken identity.   That's a fair point, but the problem is that Judge was identified as the co-assaulter, and the two guys were buddies (K was mentioned in J's book of wild times under a thin pseudonym O'Kavanaugh).   And it seems they belonged to the same social set - not many opportunities to mess up.  Taking some time to interview students from the era might help nail down their association, and Ford's statements to them at the time."
19,e6clcvs_4,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
20,e6d3cso_1,"Why do you think taking a real assault and changing the culprit is implausible?
I’m totally playing devil’s advocate and not accusing Mrs. Ford of everything, but the legal system is kind of *about* addressing potential alternative explanations.
We can say fairly confidently that Ford and Kavanaugh “moved in the same circles,” as I’ve heard a bunch of times. So ***if*** Ford is a very hardcore liberal (statistically, a psych professor is certainly more likely to be liberal than conservative, at the very least), and she finds a conservative up for nomination to the court. She doesn’t want him there, and he just happens to be someone she made acquaintance with however many decades ago."
21,e6d3cso_4,"Absent much other evidence, I don’t see any reason why that is inherently less likely than the easy explanation that he’s a predator.
Obviously it’s a case that requires more looking into, and I agree that it’s imperative that we figure out to the best of our abilities what is true and what is not. I just don’t think that “demonstrably ethically immaculate” is a great standard for this. It’s impossible to demonstrate someone’s “ethically immaculate”; the best you can do is show no marks on their record, so to speak. You’re essentially asking to prove a negative - prove he’s never done anything morally suspect - when you use that standard. I don’t think this applies to Kavanaugh, but that standard could easily mean that an accusation with even *the smallest iota* of credibility could rob the country of one of its best, most capable, upstanding jurists."
22,e6d644s_1,"It’s also not a civil case. She’s not suing for damages, she’s casting doubt on the morality of a nominee to office. To my knowledge, it’s not an actual *case* at all. It’s a hearing before the senate. There’s no standard of evidence for such a procedure.
But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school, and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted; that is, you can’t use someone’s testimony that “Ford mentioned Kavanaugh by name to me in 2012” to establish that Ford did indeed mention Kavanaugh by name in 2012. It takes more evidence than that, and it’s an objectionable and inadmissible argument. It’s called hearsay. It wouldn’t be hearsay if Ford’s husband actually testified, but in that case it would only be able to be treated as any other witness testimony given by someone with a clear bias."
23,e6d69zl_1,"&gt; But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school,
OK, Perry Mason. I see we're dealing with an expert."
24,e6d69zl_2,"&gt;  and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted;
This *ISN'T A COURT CASE*, Mr. Lionel Hutz.  Put your pelican back in your briefs."
25,dbrj3ub_1,"Most anti-feminists would become even more anti-feminist if they actually knew what is was.
&gt; most anti-feminists have either no, or a distorted, idea of what feminism actually is
I think most recognize that feminism is the promotion for women's rights/promotion for the consumerist interests of women."
26,dbrj3ub_4,"&gt;  Rather, it is addresses the very real issues women still face on a daily basis.
Well, it's certainly about addressing issues women face, by making them worse."
27,dbrm6zn,"Just saying this makes you an anti-feminist. Even though they claim the only component to being a feminist is ""egalitarianism"". "
28,dbrmdcs,"I am anti-feminist, but also anti-egalitarian in general. I'm a reactionary and have realized that every morality developed after the French revolution is complete rubbish. To bring society back to health, we must undue the institutions that made it sick in the first place. Racial and sexual egalitarianism being the core of these sicknesses. "
29,dbrmue8_1,"I mostly agree but I'm more like a Taoist who believes in eternal ideas that bring the most harmony so ""reactionary"" isn't a label I think suits me even if thats what the Marxists will call me.
One of those eternal ideas is that men and women are different, not just slightly different but yin/yang different. The best thing to do is let their differences flourish and that brings harmony."
30,de9wr2x_2,"A video of a man hitting a woman (or anyone hitting anyone) because they called them a shit head would get soundly condemned and downvoted on reddit.
A video of a man defending himself against a woman who physically attacked him would receive a significant amount of support (and some condemnation) on reddit.  That's not misogyny, that's equality."
31,d5q07u2,"Have you ever seen or read Moneyball? Its a book/movie that describes how a coach who had a third the budget of the best paid teams in American Baseball was still able to beat them. It was about how all the players who are perceived as best by fans and scouts aren't really as good as people think they are. I am not really that familiar with European football, but I think this story proves that there can still be a lot of competitiveness in professionals sports even if leagues have teams with lopsided budgets.

32,d5q0fkh,"Poorer teams can have great players like Southampton with Le Tissier, etc, but City were never a good team before their takeover. Never challenged for trophies."
33,d5q0wdg,"Yeah, in like the 1950s. They've always been mediocre afterwards. Villa won the Champions League in the 80s. Are they still a CL team?"
34,d85z3im_2,"It isn't common in either group for them to discuss gender roles/stereotypes outside of the ""attack on gender X"" box."
35,d860jzy_1,"I'm intrigued by what you're saying, but I'm just failing to see that commonly brought up in practice. Maybe my expectation is incorrect, or maybe I'm just seeing the incorrect spokespeople.
So just to take gender roles for example: I think it's incorrect to see this is a men's or a women's issue. In our society (and almost all societies since societies were invented), both women and men are equally put into roles based upon their gender."
36,d860jzy_3,"It doesn't make sense to me to discuss gender roles and only mention ones that impact a certain gender. I don't see how this helps change or resolve the problem. I don't even get why it's something feminists or MRAs would talk about if they were concerned about ending gender roles. If someone discusses gender roles, and only mentions a single gender, then I think it's reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end gender roles, but rather they want to change them to be more beneficial towards a specific gender."
37,d86dx8t_5,"&gt;To just use objectification for example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""of women"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude the male gender from the argument against objectification.
Why? Explain how that's different from: ""To use cancer as an example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""colon"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude all non-colon cancers from the effort to cure cancer."""
38,t3_2qr8gn,"""There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal, but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that ""sex with another person = relationship over"" that I don't think hold up.

 * **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 * **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. 

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. CMV!

I understand that maybe there is some benefit to academia from it, I can see it being useful in cases where some language has died out and left behind an ancient, potentially significant text and having a knowledge of how languages generally work could be beneficial to understanding and translating that text. But I think that speaking 12 languages is just peacocking and hasn't much use.

To address the gross factor, I know there are plenty of people grossed out by this idea, and thats fine. If you don't want to pee in the shower then don't. Nobody is going to force you or anything.

I don't think this behavior should be discouraged because it doesn't hurt anything. In fact, it's efficient, even if just by a little.
