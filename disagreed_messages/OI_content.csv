1,t3_30uf3s,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.

13,dzh0xpe,"Oh my, the 3rd point is not directed towards you. I can see from the other comments (and rereading my own) why you think it was. But let me clarify. The need to address global warm increases because of science deniers. 

(You seem like a reasonable guy, btw.) "
14,e6ciwm3_1,"&gt; I have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the Ford/Kavanaugh situation.
Potential corroborating evidence:"
15,e6ciwm3_2,"* The WaPost has seen therapist records from 2012 in which Ford discussed this assault.  This strongly demonsrates this story was not concocted to undermine Kavanaugh's SCOTUS nomination.
* Her husband was told in 2012 (this evidence is less useful, because he is a biased witness).
* One other woman at her school said the assault was talked about at the time.  Given time to investigate, more students at the school could be found.  This, again, shows that it pre-dates the time when K became important."
16,e6ciwm3_3,"* K's friend Mark Judge has a history of innuendo, inebriation, and, well, skeeviness.
* Any connected and demonstrated un-truths K says about not knowing the victim, his other activities at the time, etc. impugn his reliability as a witness, as well as constitute potential perjury.
You won't build a 'beyond reasonable doubt' case like in a criminal trial, but if you try you certainly have a good shot at a ""strong weight of the evidence"" case, stronger than a civil case.   And becoming a SCOTUS justice is not a right; it is a privilege extended only to the very best and most ethical."
17,e6clcvs_1,"&gt; I just have a bad feeling nothing really solid will be revealed.
Therapist notes from 2012 are reasonably solid.  Not ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" but ""strong preponderance of evidence.""       They show that this is not a politically driven claim."
18,e6clcvs_4,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
19,e6clcvs_5,"Now you might ask .... how could K (or anyone) ever have a chance against random accusations?  Well, an accusation from a woman who never knew him or never moved in his social circle would be ignored.  An accusation with no past corroborating evidence (therapist notes, witnesses) would have much less value.    An accusation by a person with a history of false accusations or mental illness would be downplayed.  Heck,  George Bush was accused of raping some nutty woman, but it was obvious that she and he had never come into proximity, so it was laughed off except by conspiracy sites."
20,e6d3cso_2,"Lightbulb!
She recalls that she discussed in relatively vague detail an assault that she was subjected to at a young age with a therapist, and that she didn’t specify any names. Given their close proximity to one another during school, the fact that he fits the profile for the perpetrators (as do doubtless hundreds of kids who went there, to be fair), and the lack of names given, it’s totally possible to put Kavanaugh’s name onto one of these nameless, faceless criminals and potentially stop his confirmation."
21,e6d3cso_5,"“Sure, we can’t *show* s/he’s not ethically immaculate, but we’ve brought doubt on it and you can’t demonstrate s/he is!”"
22,e6d69zl_1,"&gt; But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school,
OK, Perry Mason. I see we're dealing with an expert."
23,e6d69zl_2,"&gt;  and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted;
This *ISN'T A COURT CASE*, Mr. Lionel Hutz.  Put your pelican back in your briefs."
24,e6d6hj8_1,"&gt;I see we’re dealing with an expert
Finally someone recognizes and appreciates my unparalleled legal expertise."
25,dbrj3ub_2,"&gt; most anti-feminists have no idea of the realities of being a woman
That's true; men don't know what is like to work a dead end job for 30 years before waking up one morning and feeding your cat at which point you realize you utterly wasted your life. Men don't know what it is like to feel so emotionally broken that the only way you conjure life temporarily back to your permanently dead body is to be defiled by peoples who names escape you. Men don't know what it is like to have such a void in heart emotionally that the only thing of fucking meaning you can do in your life is go protest to let Muhammad into your country so maybe, just maybe, one of them is hot and rapes you in a back ally somewhere. Men don't know what it is like to be so confused by the culture that they think being objectified sexually is wrong, but getting gangbang Dp'd by 5 black dudes is ""liberating""."

30,d5q07u2,"Have you ever seen or read Moneyball? Its a book/movie that describes how a coach who had a third the budget of the best paid teams in American Baseball was still able to beat them.

I am not really that familiar with European football, but I think this story proves that there can still be a lot of competitiveness in professionals sports even if leagues have teams with lopsided budgets.

33,d5q3eh6,"Yes, because of recent times. Please link me your source for that number please."
34,d85zj9e_1,"&gt;The rape of men is considered to be humorous, while the rape of women is not (EG - the rape scene in Wedding Crashers, ""don't drop the soap"").
Agreed entirely, and feminists don't disagree that this is a problem, it's in fact part of ""rape culture"", which you hear so much about from feminists, that rape is viewed as a punitive measure, something that people are all too happy occurs in our prison system (to both men and women) and is even found funny. Feminists aren't happy with rape being trivialized in *any* context."
35,d860jzy_2,"Thus, when I see a feminist discussing gender roles and how the impact women, I conclude that they are only concerned with women being in gender roles. It'd be one thing if the argument began with ""we're going to focus on gender roles that impact woman"" or something similar, but in my experience this isn't common."
36,d860jzy_4,"So, is my reasoning incorrect? Or, is my reasoning mostly correct but I'm wrong about this being uncommon in the feminist community? The majority of my views on feminism are from NOW.Org, so if there is a more official spokesgroup for feminism then I'd be interested in seeing that as well."
37,t3_2qr8gn,"""There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal, but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that ""sex with another person = relationship over"" that I don't think hold up.

 * **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 * **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. 

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. CMV!

39,t3_24c5qv,"""I know this is a frequent topic, but I really want to have my View changed. The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora

46,dy2z5gl_1,"&gt; I don't think there are currently any prohibitions against doing this
I was thinking the same. If you had a test case of this (that is, a case in which someone actually got sick due to a specific unvaccinated person), you could conceivably make out the elements of a negligence claim:"
47,dy2z5gl_2,"1) Duty: People generally have a legal duty to exercise ""reasonable care"" to avoid injury to others. This element hinges on whether the harm caused is ""foreseeable,"" but in most circumstances, you have a duty of reasonable care to those in physical proximity to you.
Is failing to vaccinate a failure to exercise such care? I don't believe there's any precedent for that, but it's possible a court would buy that. In any case, this would be the first major legal hurdle."
48,dy2z5gl_3,"2) Breach: If there is indeed a duty, then the defendant breached that duty by not vaccinating. Easy enough.
3) Damages: Plaintiff got sick. Easy enough, this is why you are suing in the first place.
4) Causation: There are two elements to this. Was defendant's action a substantial factor in bringing about the harm (sickness)?  And was that harm (sickness) a reasonably foreseeable consequence of the defendant's failure to vaccinate?"
49,dy2z5gl_4,"The first question is a tough one. How can you prove you got sick from a specific person? Barring some sort of notable physical contact or assault, it would seem a pretty tenuous case. Heck, every time I get sick I play the game ""OK, who got me sick?"" but it's pretty much a guess."

* individual purchase and consumption of recreational drugs (provided one does not hurt anyone else due to the effects)

* the consumption of pornography (not involving coercion)

* depiction of cartoon child porn (not involving harm to actual children)

* sexting between minors (voluntary action)

* the absence of a seatbelt in a car 

I'm not saying the Government should condone the use of drugs, prostitution, or not wearing a seatbelt. What I *am* saying is I don't believe the government should have any say in what people do to themselves assuming it doesn't harm anyone, it isn't their job to make things they don't like illegal. If Someone wants to do meth, I don't think its the governments job to detain them. If someone decides they are willing to be a prostitute to make money, or a minor wants to sext their partner I really don't think the government has any reason to step in and punish them. The war on drugs (in the US at least) has been a huge failure, not only has it failed to dramatically lower instance of drug abuse but it has also put hundreds of thousands of Americans in the prison system. Minors have unregulated access to pretty much any illegal drug, more so than alcohol and tabacco which are regulated. 

I believe the government should regulate drugs, and prostitution. But aside from that people should have unregulated freedoms assuming they aren't hurting anyone.

62,t3_32cnkw,"I have been hearing a lot on the news about how $29 dollars a week for food is very difficult to live on and you can not feed yourself nutritiously for that amount. I strongly disagree with this position as I have lived for $25 when I was saving for graduate school. I actually ate healthier and lost over 20lbs fat during the process (I worked out a lot during this time also). 

I came from an immigrant background and it is not uncommon to know families that support themselves on a budget of 100-150 dollar budget for food every month. The trick is learning how to shop and how to cook. With a budget of $29/week or about $116 a month, I have seen families of 3 feed themselves (though they did work hard to make that money stretch). I believe that $29 dollars a week is plenty of money to live off of for food and the complaint is baseless. 

Here are some sample prices of groceries I purchased regularly. Taking advantage of seasonal flux in food prices can help you reduce your food costs even further. 

Starch:

20lb bag of rice - $15-20 dollars (depending on the quality) This has a higher initial cost but it ends up evening out throughout time. If you can not bare the up front cost initially, smaller bags of rice could easily be found for about 1 dollar per pound at walmart. a 20lb bag of rice lasts me about 1.5-2 months.

Pasta -~$1/lb Walmart usually has pasta at about a dollar a pound (if not more). 

Potato - ~ $.2-$.5 a pound. You can easily find a 10lb bag of potato between $2-$2.5. When they are in season, I have seen them for as low as $.5 for a 10 pound bag. 

Ramen - about 10-25 cents per bag. I tried to stay away from ramen as much as I can since they are pretty unhealthy but if you are tired and just want a quick meal, ramen gets the job done. 

Bread - $1 per loaf at walmart/aldi 

cereal - $4 for a giant bag of generic brand cereal at walmart. Those usually lasts me at least 2-3 weeks. 

Protein

whole chicken: between $1-$1.5/lb. Walmart and Aldi usually have them in a pack of 2 for 6-8 dollars. I usually buy two per week. 

Pork Shoulders: usually between $1-$2/lb. Other parts of the pig often go on sale for below $2/lb so shop as you see fit. 

Kielbasa/smoked sausage - Usually $2/lb

ground pork/turkey - ~$2.5/lb

Whole Turkey - $1-$2/lb when not in season. I usually buy 1-2 turkey right after thanksgiving when they go on sale for around $.5/lb and freeze them. Then I roast the turkey, break it down and use the meat for sandwich meat. I make stock/soups from the bones/skin/fat/left over bits. 

Beans - ~ $1-1.5/lb, a good source of protein fiber and starch. It is also absolutely delicious if you cook them right.

Eggs - ~$.15/egg. I usually buy them in huge packs of 48. They end up costing around 6-7 dollars per pack and the pack usually lasts me the month. 

Tofu - $.5-$1/lb I usually purchase tofu in Asian markets and they are usually about 1 dollar pack. I can't remember the exact size of the package but they are at least 1lb. 

Peanut Butter - $2-$3 for a huge jar. Even cheaper if you buy the industrial size ones. 


Veggies

Here is the part that gets slightly trickier. I really like veggies and I also use a lot of Asian veggies that are not as accessible for much of the population. I also take advantage of my local farmer's market and really pay attention to what veggies are in season. the price flux on veggies are hard to predict for country so these are just general estimates for the prices. For the sake of argument, I will stick to veggies that are common throughout the US. 


Onions -  $.5-.75/lb you can find onions easily enough at any super market for about 2-3 dollars for a bag. Depending on the season and your location, I seen them for as little as $1/5lb bag. When onions are on sale like that I usually buy a lot and freeze them. 

Cucumber - $.25-$.5/cucumber 

Zucchini/squash - $.25-$.5 per unit. I usually only buy these when they are in season. You can usually get a nice variety during the summer, often for even cheaper. 

Tomatoes - ~ $1-$1.5/lb. You can find them for incredibly cheap during the summers. I have walked away from a box (estimating between 12-15lbs) for $7.5. Usually if I find them cheap, I make tomato sauce with them. [A really simple but amazing recipe is just butter, onion, and tomatoes](http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1015178-marcella-hazans-tomato-sauce). The recipe is by Marcella Hazan (picture Julia Child of Italian cooking) and it tastes absolutely amazing. When I first the recipe, I was very very hesitant and did not think it would taste good at all but it ended up being one of the best tomato sauces I have ever tried. You can freeze/can the sauce to save for later. 

Peppers - I usually go to mexican/asian markets for peppers. They usually sell by the pound and you can usually get 3-4 green or red peppers for about a dollar. I also use tons of jalapenos and 1 dollar will get you a huge bag in those markets. 

Carrots - easily found all year round for &lt;$1 a pound. 

Eggplant - once again, I usually only buy these in season but they usually go for about $2-3 per box (I am guessing around $1/lb). 

Lettuce - $1/head I usually don't eat that much lettuce but they can be found cheaply.

Corn - $.1/-$.25/ear Once again, keep it seasonable. 

Herbs - I usually pick up cilantro, scallion, ginger, and garlic at the mexican/asian markets. They tend to be significantly cheaper. Once again, I understand not everyone have access to these. Cilantro - $.5/bunch; Scallion usually $1 for 2-4 bunches; ginger - I honestly can't remember but i usually never pay over a dollar for it and it lasts me several weeks; garlic - a bundle of 5 goes for about $1. 

Fruits

I unfortunately am not a big fruit eater so I don't have too much info on this...

I understand there are issues such as some mexican/asian stores doesn't accept food stamps, I shop at farmer's markets sometimes and they definitely do not accept food stamps, but vast majority of my shopping came from aldi/walmart so I think these prices are realistic. Additionally, I also understand food prices different from city to city, I have only really lived in medium size cities (largest being Boston) so I don't know if my experiences can be applied to NYC, LA, SF, and places like that. Lastly, if you are using cash, you can negotiate prices with vendors at farmer's markets. Especially if you wait until the market is about to be closed, a lot of vendors are willing to sell you what they have left at a ridiculously low price (I have literally walked away with boxes and crates full of food for less than 10 dollars). 


Sample Week of Groceries:

(I am reducing the price of some of these from my prices since I wouldn't use the whole container/amount).

2 Chickens - $8

1lb of Rice ~ $.7

1lb of pasta - $1

2lb of potato - $1

Herbs ~ $1

2lb of beans - $2

2lbs of Tofu - $2

Eggs - $1.5

Celery - $1

Peppers - $1

Tomatoes - $2

Cucumbers - $2

Onions - $1

cereal - $1

Milk - $1.5

bread - $1

Peanut Butter - $1

Total: $28.7

With $29 dollars you get ~ 7 pounds of protein from the chicken and tofu. You also get additional protein from PB, eggs, and beans. You'll have ~ 2lbs of cooked rice, a whole loaf of bread, 2lb of potatoes,  &gt;1lb of cooked pasta, and breakfast cereal for your starch. You will also have 4-8 cucumbers, 2-4 bell peppers, ~ 1.5lb of tomatoes, and ~ 2lb of onions for your veggies. 

For breakfast: 

Toast with peanut butter and egg. Cereal if you want a change of pace. 

Lunch/dinner 

Debone the chicken and you are left with 4 breasts, 4 thighs, 4 wings, 4 drumsticks, and 4 tenders. Rest of the meat and the bones goes into a stock pot with 1/2 the celery, and onions (and possibly some carrots) for chicken soup. With the rest of the meat, you can make chicken salad, pulled chicken, grilled chicken, etc (use your imagination). There are tons of things you can do with tofu and you can make some delicious pasta dishes with the garlic, and tomatoes. Rice and Bean is always a solid option and you can opt out of a chicken for some sausage or pork. 

Concerns and arguments against: 

I understand some states still taxes food (I am not sure if you ever get taxed for food stamps). I know I cut it pretty close to the $29 mark but I honestly think this is way more food than a reasonable person should eat in a week (more than 2lb of food/day from the starches, chicken, and tofu alone). 

I also am operating on a stocked pantry. I know my calculations does not account for this but pantries are stocked over time and it is way to hard to figure out how much veggie oil you'll use/cost for the week. Stocking a pantry also is not very expensive, flour, salt, sugar, pepper, cornmeal, soy sauce, oil, baking soda, etc should not cost more than $20 all together. You can get pretty far with just salt, sugar, pepper, oil, and the herbs I included. You can also slowly stock up your spice collection. Basics such as garlic powder/chili/cayenne/oregano, are all around 2-3 dollars tops and they last a very long time. 

Some people lack the time to properly cook their meals:

I worked two jobs (full time and a part time) while saving for my graduate school. I will usually have at least 1 night/weekend day free. I usually prepare my food for the week that night so I don't have to spend time cooking everyday. 

Food deserts:

This is a pretty legitimate concern. I honestly had no experience with this issue but I have heard plenty about it. For the most part, I had a car so shopping was relatively a simple task. I understand that without transportation, while living in a food desert, getting cheap fresh groceries is an issue. However, I think this is more of a city or community issue that needs to be address rather than the food stamp amount. I also have taken public transportation to grocery shop (it sucks but you do what you have to do). I have also known plenty of immigrants who carpool to grocery shop. None of these solutions are elegant but I have seem plenty of people make it work. 


Change my view!"
63,t1_cqacc9t_1,"I definitely agree that meal prep will take time, no matter how negligible. However, we all have to spent time preparing meals unless you have the luxury of eating out every meal. I do understand that time might be more valuable for those in the circumstances you described so I will make a concession there. I also understand that you don't get to keep the money you don't spend and that makes things more difficult (though you could invest in dry goods, sauces/non perishables, or things for your pantry).  ∆"
64,t1_cqacc9t_2,"I think there could be a little more wiggle room, I guess my original point is an reaction to those who say $29 dollars is impossible."

69,dmo09h9,It's also because restaurants are complaint-avoidant now more than ever. If 99 people like having two gender-neutral washrooms and 1 person goes on Yelp and one-stars them because of it then that's a net negative for the place.

The same goes for sexism and other forms of discrimination that generally aren't acceptable in modern society but that we tend to give the Baby Boomers and prior generations a pass on.  The fact that the man in the article is a public figure is the only reason his racism is coming under fire, because if any other old man/woman said the same shit, even the least racist people I know would shrug and say something about not even being worth the confrontation due to them being so old and set in their ways.  I believe that no matter how old you are, you have to live up to the standards of the society you live in *now*, not the one you lived in growing up.

84,t3_2ikw3y,"I love the Matrix Trilogy. Personal views on acting ability aside, I believe that the premise that the Matrix establishes is one that can only be rivaled by a few movies. The way the stories are told bring forth endless possibilities to the true nature of the film. I also believe that a lot of the hate towards the film comes from the inability to follow the overarching idea.

I do not want to argue the execution of the film (i.e. cast, cgi quality, light use of cords). I only want to argue the structure and intent of the movie. Sequence of events and dialogue between characters are fair game, just not the actor's ability to show any emotion saying them. 

What I am asking is this, did the trilogy make philosophical or logical mistakes big enough that destroy the integrity of the film.

85,t1_cl3abkm,"∆

There we go. These are the questions I'm looking for. Some of that sequencing really doesn't make sense now that you point it out. Good job!"
86,t3_2fo07m,"So I was reading in a manga where one person has control over ice and can well it into existence whenever they want (I am avoiding giving the same since I don't know how to spoiler tag and I don't want to give the name away since it's a big deal later) eventually the person develops the ability to freeze time for about 10 or so minutes. This development got me thinking since a lot of people I know think that being able to control fire is (no pun intended) hot shit I Began to think that controlling ice would be much better; reasons ?



Ice only needs water or any liquid to be made so as long as I have anything that has any liquid at on such as nearly every place on earth I can make ice, this is not the same with fire which needs oxygen so If I froze the person in a very compact ice shell the person wouldn't be able to create fire since they would waste all the oxygen and I would just keep reinforcing the shell so 1v1 the ice wins

Second profit: I can freeze time and walk into a bank freeze the vault and then sledgehammer bam no vault door I would be able to see all the lasers due to the mist from the ice so I can dodge lasers and bam I am a billionaire who did it with style. 


Third I would never pay for gas or ships or anything since I can freeze everything I would just sit down in my nice comfortable chair and have an ice dragon which I would make(it's no alive but it pushes me) to take me anywhere.


4th I would be amazing at places where people want cold or cooler temperature If I see a very attractive girl saying gosh I wish it was colder BAM ice man over here I can do that for you and chill the area down like 15 or so degrees that's a guaranteed hello at least also your cooler ran out of ice don't worry BAM cold beers, who is the savior of the alcohol this guy. 


5th personal use: since I would be controlling it I would get used to cold temperatures so when it gets cold to winter guess who gets to go outside shirtless and in shorts since I would be used to the cold


There are obviously more reasons that I will bring up later if asked (I don't know them yet but I will eventually)
So people who would are boring 
pyromancers as opposed to the cool as ice, ice...Cyro...mancers??? Please attempt to CMV 
"
87,t1_ckb783v,Cyromancers can lower the temperature to absolute zero where all motion stops effectively freezing time 
88,t1_ckb7d0j,Also if armor is metal I can make is so cold it would basically freeze onto you 
89,t1_ckbnz2j,Very nice points I like your style of writing and you counter just about every point with an equal reason why pyromancer would be cool I have to give you a delta nicely done sir Δ
90,t3_2bk0qs,"It probably goes without saying that I support capital punishment, if not in practice then at least in principle.

More than that, I find the outcry sparked from the botched executions of rapists and murderers to be somewhat ridiculous. I find nothing ethically wrong with subjecting a condemned man to some measure of suffering before his death. If someone has killed another person by, say, raping and then burying their victim alive, what makes an hour or two of suffering on their way out so unacceptable?

Since Reddit is largely liberal, I'd expect a healthy response, but let me clarify my position before rebuttals are made:

1. My issue is with the ethics of inflicting pain before execution. I'm perfectly aware and agree that according to law anything more than a swift and painless death would be inhumane and therefore illegal.

2. I'm also assuming that such additional suffering would be administered to admitted and unapologetic killers whose crimes were heinous enough to warrant such action. The uncertainty surrounding most court trials would be enough to keep me from supporting any actual policy for this. This is purely meant to discuss the ethics of the ""ideal situation"".

91,t3_29cqd5,"In many superhero TV shows and comics, superheroes are extremely unwilling to kill villains, instead preferring to capture them. Ordinarily, this would be fine, and I think it is for the most part effective against ordinary criminals who are easily contained. When we consider supervillains, we consistently see that they either break free of capture or avoid getting captured in the first place. These villains often go on to pursue other schemes that result in significant harm or death to innocent civilians. If that's the case, then it would be better for heroes to apply lethal force in order to prevent villains from escaping and endangering more lives. Note that this does not always entail killing. A hero would not be justified in killing a villain if merely handicapping that villain would be equally or more effective at preventing harm. My basic argument boils down to:

1. It is justified to use the minimal amount of force necessary to safely prevent a person from infringing on others' rights, provided that the minimal amount is still reasonably proportional to the crime that would be committed (We would permit a John to kill Jack if it was necessary in order to prevent Jack from killing another person, but would not allow John to kill Jack if it were the minimal amount of force necessary to prevent him from stealing $5.)

2. Supervillains often commit crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people. 

3. Crimes that result in numerous deaths or at the very least, a significant amount of danger to the lives of innocent people warrant the criminal being killed if necessary.

4. Thus, the crimes that supervillains commit warrant them being killed if it is necessary.

5. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is the minimal amount of force to subdue them as capture is not an option.

C. Killing or handicapping a supervillain is morally permissible; obligatory if you think superheroes have a moral obligation to stop villains.

**TL;DR:** Killing or handicapping prevents villains from infringing on others rights better than simple capture does, so superheroes should use those means.

Extra note: I bring up killing because for certain varieties of villains, such as psychic villains like Psimon, magic villains like Loki, or smart villains like Lex Luthor cannot have their relevant abilities handicapped without doing something that is probably about as bad as killing them (granted, I don't know enough about superhero universes to know if there are ways to disable these abilities).

92,t3_21rsdj,"Hi /r/CMV,

I'm a senior in high school, and I have never really been a huge reader. I read one series addictively in 4th grade, The Guardians of Ga'Hoole, and have read various books over the years but have never gotten into it much other than that, especially lately. I got halfway through the Steve Jobs biography last summer and enjoyed it a lot, and plan on finishing it, but haven't had time/motivation so far. I have a couple other books that sound interesting to me but I've never gotten around to. Many people say that reading is really good for you, and important. I consider myself intelligent (not in an arrogant way, but I am intellectual and can handle myself well in academic, philosophical, and logic based conversations, to summarize crudely), and understand that I may enjoy reading when I'm a little older. 

However.. I'm just wondering, is that truly necessary? Is it a necessary fact of life, inevitable for me to fall into, or is it simply society's chosen medium of information and life fulfillment? 

I am not inactive physically or mentally. I do karate, play basketball, baseball, every instrument in my own rock music solo album, I write, I rock climb, I teach karate, I think, I do various forms of yoga including hatha and acro-yoga, and I have discussions and debates with people often. 

I'm sure reading couldn't hurt this list, but it's so painful for me, I just have no desire. I haven't read a single word of my assigned books in school this year, as I preferred to participate in the class discussions and write quality essays based on these discussions. 

Without telling me just that ""reading is good for me"", please change my view by providing a good argument for why I absolutely need to read books, even if it's only during a certain time in my life. 

I should add that I read articles on the Internet all the time, tech related, politics related, whatever reddit force feeds me :P so I have the capacity to read, but I guess I haven't found justification for reading full books so far. To reiterate in a more simple way, is reading just a personal passion that can achieve great benefits, or is it something that everybody needs to do, myself included? (Seeing as I don't have a passion for reading personally).

So reddit, change my view.

93,t1_cgfx1ks_1,"College, very good point. I just assumed that I would suck it up for college but yeah habits don't just suddenly happen in college, that's a little piece of wisdom I've heard. And yes, I definitely agree on books providing a similar knowledge path as forms or curriculum in karate (we actually don't call them kata lol, but I learned that word in the past year from talking to martial artists from around the country, so I understood!), and you made a good argument for it (your writing style), so emotionally I am inclined to agree because your description was vivid and exciting, but logically I am wondering if you have really changed my view. Basically, you made an argument for how reading can enrich my life in a similar way to the other things I already do."

96,t3_1io050,"I think the whole way of ""life"" of the Borg seems pretty great. They have all they need, they have a telos, and they strike me as more possible for humanity to achieve than the peace required by the Federation.

To the first point, that they have all their needs taken care of and have an arsenal and quick, global hive learning which renders them nearly indestructible. Death is no object because life is in service to the hive and corpses are taken up for resources and information.

The second point is pretty cool. The whole of the Borg is driven by a sense of purpose--approaching perfection through incorporating greater intelligence and diversity into themselves. While individual humans have senses of purpose, the whole of humanity has no agreed-upon purpose and human conflict is the result. The Borg are internally peaceful.

The third point, that it is a likelier future for humanity than the Federation, I base in part on the accelerating returns of technology. We already have human brain-to-computer interfacing and rat brain-to-brain interfacing. With cloud computing as well, it is looking pretty likely that sooner or later we will have internet-facilitated human brain-to-brain interfacing. I consider the singularity an inevitability barring nuclear holocaust or environmental collapse, while the peace required of a Federation member I consider highly unlikely from a non-hivemind humanity.

Two elements of the Borg I expect to come up here:

Individuality. Rather, the lack of it. Though I have it and enjoy it, for the Borg it is a non-issue. It is a tradeoff, initially, to be sure, individuality for a hive mind, but afterward, the Borg are no more aware of individuality than are our individual neurons. It is a clumsiness shed in favour of a larger system with loftier goals higher purposes, and greater abilities to realize those goals and purposes. The individuals of the Borg act like the hands and eyes and neurons of a larger organism, not as independent specimens, so I consider it insufficient to say ""I don't want to be a Borg person"". There is no such thing. Your consciousness and identity are those of the hive. Your body is no longer tied to your personhood.

Secondly, violence. Assimilation sounds pretty bad, no? But in First Contact we learn that the Borg do not just kidnap and plug in, and that's the end. They kidnap, and forcefully expose lifeforms to the benefits of the Collective, and await free choice to join or not.

Even so, this is extremely violent. It is not injurious to the person (on the contrary, it is empowering!). It doesn't change human history, but only human future. And the new human future would be one in which, on top of our own creativity and intellect, we can capitalize on that if others too, and even other species.

So, I believe the Borg to be a better (and likelier) future for humanity than a (mostly) peaceful Federation of Planets. Change my view."

**PICARD:** Offering myself? ...That's it. I remember now. It wasn't enough that you assimilate me. I had to give myself freely to the Borg, ...to you.
**BORG QUEEN:** You flatter yourself. I've overseen the assimilation of countless millions. You were no different.
**PICARD:** You're lying. You wanted more than just another Borg drone. You wanted a human being with a mind of his own, who could bridge the gulf between humanity and the Borg. You wanted a counterpart, but I resisted. I fought you."

Later, Data too says that for a fraction of a second, an eternity to an android, he was tempted by her offer. Note that it was an offer, not compulsory."
100,t1_cb6cyg7_1,"I think this is the key line of dialogue that infers otherwise:
PICARD: Offering myself? ...That's it. I remember now. It wasn't enough that you assimilate me. I had to give myself freely to the Borg, ...to you.
**BORG QUEEN: You flatter yourself. I've overseen the assimilation of countless millions. You were no different.**"
101,t1_cb6ugvx_1,"my view has been changed, somewhat.  Together with /u/evercharmer, you've made me feel that while *being* the Borg sounds optimal, being forcefully assimilated sounds pretty terrible.  Perhaps if the Borg just said ""Join us for better everything"" and people joined willingly, I'd have no qualms, but together, you have made forceful assimilation look inexcusable (not in itself, but because it destroys one of the aspects of humanity which is most valuable: independence of choice)."
102,t3_1ekme5,"Hi, I recently completed a degree in philosophy.  When I had the opportunity to engage with my philosophy professor's research I always found it valuable, if not also interesting.  Some problems in formal logic, for example, bear immediate importance to issues in subjects like computer programming and math.  Even philosophy that doesn't seem as 'useful,' such as aesthetics and metaphysics, seems valuable insofar as it is the pursuit of an accurate understanding of reality at a very foundational level. 

But I've never encountered this kind of value in the research of English professors.  To use cliché examples, I don't see how themes of death in Hamlet, or the role of silence in Attic Greek tragedies, valuably informs our understanding of the universe, or gives us any 'practical' benefit.  These interests do not seem like the sort of thing that major research institutions should fund in the large-scale way that they do now.  In some institutions, for example, there are well over a hundred tenure-level English professors.  I don't see why most of these professors ought not be phased out and replaced with professional lecturers.  Their work seems interesting as a hobby - I think that many people could discuss the role of silence in Greek tragedy for hours if they wanted - but I don't think that it's valuable on the level of philosophy, physics, math, anthropology, etc.

I'm sorry to be so vague about what I mean by 'value' here.  I was hoping that you folks could help me work that out if you can.  Thanks :)"
103,t1_ca15czv_2,"A lot of the Greek tragedies, especially something like Oedipus or Antigone, were very moralistic and would also deal with religion. They act as an excellent source for understanding which qualities (intelligence, strength, wit, etc.) were valued in those cultures and what was thought of religion (free will v. control by the Gods, unconditionally good v. flawed Gods etc.)."
104,t3_2ww2gf,"I am stuck in a rut at my current job and need to do something about it. I want to actually do something I feel like I can make a difference with (I really want to be a vet) but I grew up in a household where money was always tight and learned to not bite off more than I can chew. Being in a debt and owing people money is a huge deal to me and I try to avoid it at all costs.

I wasn't to go to school to be a vet but I feel like it will only make things worse by piling on student debts or not being able to find a job in my field (or both). How accurate is this assumption?



**EDIT: I thank you all for replying to this topic. I honestly wasnt expecting to change the profession but looking at these posts and knowing myself, I would be better suited to studying to be a VET TECH and enroll at community college for the first couple of years and transfer.  I am 26 living in Utah and have put off doing any sort of higher education just based on the whole debt/job field issue but I am going to start making some changes and speak to some career advisors at SLCC (the local community college here) and get started. 
I cant thank you all enough for all the advice given to me!!**

105,t1_counjd7_1,"A college education need not always go hand-in-hand with a large amount of student debt. A responsible approach to your education would allow you to achieve your goals without taking out debts that you may be unable to pay back.
That means looking towards other methods to pay for schooling that aren't debt (using funds from work, grants, or scholarships), looking into cheap schooling options (testing out of general education or attending community college), and perhaps even responsible loans based on a realistic analysis of your future earning potential. You could even look at work-study programs or the military as a route to low-debt education."
