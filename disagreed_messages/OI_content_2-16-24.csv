0,t3_30uf3s,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.
