150,d864huv_1,"Your reasoning isn't incorrect, but you're holding specific groups to unreasonable standards. Putting aside the point that feminism isn't a homogeneous group of views and doesn't have any 'official' spokespeople, there are a few reasons why this is the case:
&gt;Thus, when I see a feminist discussing gender roles and how the impact women, I conclude that they are only concerned with women being in gender roles. It'd be one thing if the argument began with ""we're going to focus on gender roles that impact woman"" or something similar, but in my experience this isn't common.
Why can't this be implied? When you see a poster that says ""5k To Cure Colon Cancer"", do you expect it to say ""We recognize and appreciate that colon cancer is not the only cancer, and that prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and a litany of non-cancerous illnesses are all horrible diseases in their own right. However, as an organization started by and for patients, families, and loved ones affected specifically by colon, we are specifically attempting to raise money for colon cancer.""

Firstly, there are no longer any laws in our country that are sexist.
