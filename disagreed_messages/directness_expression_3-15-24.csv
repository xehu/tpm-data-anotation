0,t3_30uf3s,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.

And yes, I definitely agree on books providing a similar knowledge path as forms or curriculum in karate (we actually don't call them kata lol, but I learned that word in the past year from talking to martial artists from around the country, so I understood!), and you made a good argument for it (your writing style), so emotionally I am inclined to agree because your description was vivid and exciting, but logically I am wondering if you have really changed my view. Basically, you made an argument for how reading can enrich my life in a similar way to the other things I already do.",Yes - Direct Expression,helena

375,t3_2ww2gf,"I am stuck in a rut at my current job and need to do something about it. I want to actually do something I feel like I can make a difference with (I really want to be a vet) but I grew up in a household where money was always tight and learned to not bite off more than I can chew. Being in a debt and owing people money is a huge deal to me and I try to avoid it at all costs.

I wasn't to go to school to be a vet but I feel like it will only make things worse by piling on student debts or not being able to find a job in my field (or both). How accurate is this assumption?



**EDIT: I thank you all for replying to this topic. I honestly wasnt expecting to change the profession but looking at these posts and knowing myself, I would be better suited to studying to be a VET TECH and enroll at community college for the first couple of years and transfer.  I am 26 living in Utah and have put off doing any sort of higher education just based on the whole debt/job field issue but I am going to start making some changes and speak to some career advisors at SLCC (the local community college here) and get started. 
I cant thank you all enough for all the advice given to me!!**
