0,t3_30uf3s,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.

16,dzgz6m2_2,"2. We are currently experiencing massive extinction period. Global warming is one of the many reasons too.

18,e6ciwm3_1,"&gt; I have a feeling that no corroborating or falsifying evidence is going to present itself with regard to the Ford/Kavanaugh situation.
Potential corroborating evidence:"
19,e6ciwm3_2,"* The WaPost has seen therapist records from 2012 in which Ford discussed this assault.  This strongly demonsrates this story was not concocted to undermine Kavanaugh's SCOTUS nomination.
* Her husband was told in 2012 (this evidence is less useful, because he is a biased witness).
* One other woman at her school said the assault was talked about at the time.  Given time to investigate, more students at the school could be found.  This, again, shows that it pre-dates the time when K became important."
20,e6ciwm3_3,"* K's friend Mark Judge has a history of innuendo, inebriation, and, well, skeeviness.
* Any connected and demonstrated un-truths K says about not knowing the victim, his other activities at the time, etc. impugn his reliability as a witness, as well as constitute potential perjury.
You won't build a 'beyond reasonable doubt' case like in a criminal trial, but if you try you certainly have a good shot at a ""strong weight of the evidence"" case, stronger than a civil case.   And becoming a SCOTUS justice is not a right; it is a privilege extended only to the very best and most ethical."
21,e6ciwm3_4,"&gt; and I believe something happened to her, but I’m of the opinion that allegations are not enough ... I believe she is supremely credible with regard to the claim that something happened to her.
OK, so you *believe* that K perjured himself in front of Congress.  That's a felony.  You believe K is  a felon.  You said it, not me.   Are you 90% certain?  Would you appoint someone who is a felon with 90% certainty to the court?"
22,e6clcvs_1,"&gt; I just have a bad feeling nothing really solid will be revealed.
Therapist notes from 2012 are reasonably solid.  Not ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" but ""strong preponderance of evidence.""       They show that this is not a politically driven claim."
23,e6clcvs_4,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
24,e6ctqqw_5,"&gt; This case has no merit especially since ford refuses to even accuse him under oath
She wants to talk to the FBI, and lying to the FBI is just as illegal as lying under oath.  *Then* she wants to testify under oath."
25,e6d3cso_1,"Why do you think taking a real assault and changing the culprit is implausible?
I’m totally playing devil’s advocate and not accusing Mrs. Ford of everything, but the legal system is kind of *about* addressing potential alternative explanations.
We can say fairly confidently that Ford and Kavanaugh “moved in the same circles,” as I’ve heard a bunch of times. So ***if*** Ford is a very hardcore liberal (statistically, a psych professor is certainly more likely to be liberal than conservative, at the very least), and she finds a conservative up for nomination to the court. She doesn’t want him there, and he just happens to be someone she made acquaintance with however many decades ago."
26,e6d3cso_2,"Lightbulb!
She recalls that she discussed in relatively vague detail an assault that she was subjected to at a young age with a therapist, and that she didn’t specify any names. Given their close proximity to one another during school, the fact that he fits the profile for the perpetrators (as do doubtless hundreds of kids who went there, to be fair), and the lack of names given, it’s totally possible to put Kavanaugh’s name onto one of these nameless, faceless criminals and potentially stop his confirmation."
27,e6d3cso_3,"If someone believes hard enough that conservatives are evil and do not deserve power, why hesitate to use *any means possible* to stop him?
Hell, we need not even go *that* far. What if, even if K did *not* assault her, she still feels like his moral character is in question based on *other* experiences with him? Maybe she’s willing to use whatever means necessary to stop someone who isn’t “demonstrably ethically immaculate,” as you say, from being appointed for the foreseeable future?"
28,e6d3v4s_1,"&gt; Why do you think taking a real assault and changing the culprit is implausible?
Only a very small fraction of people make false accusations of assault.  The likelihood that anyone  *who knows* you (or me, or Kavanaugh) would do this, probably.  Then only a fraction of people were assaulted, so the potential pool of people to commit this swap-eroo is tiny."
29,e6d3v4s_2,"You need a certain improbable level of crazy to concoct an assault, then you need to get get *really really improbable* and have this improbably crazy accuser already have been assaulted by somebody perfectly fitting K's description.
Improbable is approximately the same as implausible.  The simple and more probable explanation is that she's telling the truth."
30,e6d4v67_2,"The fact that most assault accusations are true (which in itself is questionable - this isn’t exactly an easy thing to confidently figure out statistically-speaking) I’m sure was very comforting to all the people who’ve had to be exonerated years later because of a false accusation, or those people *still in jail* because we haven’t yet figured out they’re innocent."
31,e6d4v67_3,"If you were a prosecutor in those cases, would you argue that only a small minority of accusations are lies, and that that should be another reason to convict? What if, 20, 30, 40 years later, the defendant is released because of backlogged DNA evidence that exonerates him - would you stand by that argument? If it were me, I would feel very guilty. I’ve done nothing illegal, but I’d feel as though I’d committed prosecutorial misconduct."
32,e6d4v67_5,"I mean, *statistically*, I, as a black man, am much more likely to be killed by another black man in this country. So as a prosecutor, would you look at the jury and say “Statistically, it’s much more likely that the defendant committed this murder because he is black, and that makes it *more likely* that he’s guilty than that suspect #2 is guilty.”"
33,e6d4v67_6,"I guess you wouldn’t, but from a statistical standpoint, that argument is just as valid as the one you made.
And hell, if I continue to play devil’s advocate, that might make it even more likely; Ford’s a smart social scientist who undoubtedly *knows* this statistic that you’ve given, and she understands psychology, so she knows that statistical arguments can have a lot of power, and that will play into her hand."
34,e6d4v67_7,"Again, I don’t know anything about Ford personally, so this isn’t an accusation. But from where I stand, there’s nothing to tip the scales of probability in either direction absent actual substantial evidence. That’s why I think we should focus on that kind of evidence.
&gt;straw-woman
No, because I’m not actually attributing this to her. As I said, it’s an alternative explanation with nothing inherently wrong with it. And by the way, I wrote a second paragraph that had *another* alternative explanation that you didn’t address. It’s not like my scenario hinges on her being a crazy hardcore liberal. She could just be someone who believes that the ends justify the means, I suppose. But again, I don’t know, and I’m not saying that *any* of this is actually true. But we also don’t know that *your* explanation is true."
35,e6d5ndb,"&gt; There’s a very good reason that statistical arguments don’t hold up in court. ... If you were a prosecutor in those cases ...

This isn't a criminal case.  

BTW, 51% is the standard in civil law (preponderance of evidence)."
36,e6d6hj8_2,"&gt;This ISN’T A COURT CASE
Inconsistent. Very unbecoming of someone making an argument."
37,dbrj3ub_1,"Most anti-feminists would become even more anti-feminist if they actually knew what is was.
&gt; most anti-feminists have either no, or a distorted, idea of what feminism actually is
I think most recognize that feminism is the promotion for women's rights/promotion for the consumerist interests of women."
38,dbrj3ub_4,"&gt;  Rather, it is addresses the very real issues women still face on a daily basis.
Well, it's certainly about addressing issues women face, by making them worse."
39,dbrlkqg,"Dude, you sound depressed.  I think you might want to look into some professional help.  I really wish you peace and happiness.  "

41,dbrmue8_1,"I mostly agree but I'm more like a Taoist who believes in eternal ideas that bring the most harmony so ""reactionary"" isn't a label I think suits me even if thats what the Marxists will call me.
One of those eternal ideas is that men and women are different, not just slightly different but yin/yang different. The best thing to do is let their differences flourish and that brings harmony."
42,de9wr2x_1,"&gt; I just don't like it when people, on any sub, post a video of a guy hitting a woman because she called him a shit head, with hundreds of comments commending the man and calling it equal rights.
Can you post a link to the posting of this video, because my guess is that you've either misinterpreted it, or misrepresented it."
43,d5q0fkh,"Poorer teams can have great players like Southampton with Le Tissier, etc, but City were never a good team before their takeover. Never challenged for trophies."
44,d85vi9n_3,"&gt; Most feminists forget that while women had to metaphorically fight for the right to vote in the past, a majority of men literally had to fight (through military service) for the right to vote. Women's suffrage was about earning the right to vote while avoiding the burdens that came along with that right.
So, because women did not have to physically fight for the right to vote, they are somehow dodging fighting responsibilities? How can you say this when feminists have worked so hard to allow women to join the military? It's men that have kept women out of the military."
45,d85y4rt_2,"&gt;Gender stereotypes are portrayed as a women's issue by only speaking of the negative ones associated to women.
[You'll find this poster is incredibly popular in, you guessed it, Feminist circles](https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-every-girl-every-boy)"
46,d860jzy_1,"I'm intrigued by what you're saying, but I'm just failing to see that commonly brought up in practice. Maybe my expectation is incorrect, or maybe I'm just seeing the incorrect spokespeople.
So just to take gender roles for example: I think it's incorrect to see this is a men's or a women's issue. In our society (and almost all societies since societies were invented), both women and men are equally put into roles based upon their gender."
47,d860jzy_4,"So, is my reasoning incorrect? Or, is my reasoning mostly correct but I'm wrong about this being uncommon in the feminist community? The majority of my views on feminism are from NOW.Org, so if there is a more official spokesgroup for feminism then I'd be interested in seeing that as well."
48,d864huv_2,"&gt;It doesn't make sense to me to discuss gender roles and only mention ones that impact a certain gender. I don't see how this helps change or resolve the problem. I don't even get why it's something feminists or MRAs would talk about if they were concerned about ending gender roles. If someone discusses gender roles, and only mentions a single gender, then I think it's reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end gender roles, but rather they want to change them to be more beneficial towards a specific gender.
Again, if someone discusses curing cancer and only mentions a single type of cancer, is it reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end cancer, but rather they want to change the landscape of medical research funding to be more beneficial towards a specific cancer?"
49,d864huv_3,"Look at it via a real-world example: let's say you're a female nursing school graduate, and you just got your license. You're on google looking around for nursing jobs, and you find some literature that says that [female nurses get paid less than male nurses even across every controllable variable](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2208795) regarding hours worked, experience level, specialty, etc. You think to yourself ""this is bullshit, I deserve equal pay for equal work,"" so you sign up for some mailing lists and donate to the NOW PAC. Is this a bad faith act because it doesn't also address the prevalence of men in hazardous jobs or lack of healthcare funding for combat veterans?"
50,d86bqrm_1,"&gt; Why can't this be implied? When you see a poster that says ""5k To Cure Colon Cancer"", do you expect it to say ""We recognize and appreciate that colon cancer is not the only cancer...
It's not implied though, and this is fine. When people donate to these causes there is no expectation that the money is going towards curing all forms of cancer. Those and other groups are very clear on what their goal is, and don't misrepresent themselves. Feminism's goal is to advance the status of women, but often the claim is that they seek equality."
51,d86cm12_2,"If my dream is to be a cement worker, it's pretty great to be male. If my dream is to run a daycare center, it's going to suck to be male. If I happen to be getting sentenced for murder, I'd do just about anything to be female rather than male."
52,d86dx8t_1,"&gt;I think where we disagree is probably on our views of what equality means in this context. My view is that women already have social, political, and economic equality to men.
This is demonstrably untrue in many ways. There's an enormous amount of evidence for things like pay disparity (even controlling for choice of work, hours, experience, etc), rates of sexual assault, reproductive rights, healthcare costs, and on and on. But even if it weren't:"
53,d86dx8t_5,"&gt;To just use objectification for example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""of women"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude the male gender from the argument against objectification.
Why? Explain how that's different from: ""To use cancer as an example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""colon"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude all non-colon cancers from the effort to cure cancer."""

You are correct that this is false. However, I would say that *cheaters are more likely to cheat again*. The circumstances that resulted in cheating the first time may repeat."
55,ddxprq8_1,"There are more parts I disagree with, but I'll talk about this one
&gt;Children don't need to consume milk and green leafy vegetables like raw spinach contain much more vitamin D and calcium. Proteins can easily be obtained from legumes.
I can't stand large amount of foods, I can't even touch some, I just find it disgusting. My parents tried to force me to eat them for many years, but whenever they did, I refused. They told me that I couldn't leave table till I ate it. Sometimes I was there even few hours. In the end, they couldn't force me to start eating these things.

95,dv8nqq1_1,"I'm buffering, I'll get back to you in a second, but this has made me think. However, for that logic, I could still call my equality movement ""fuck you all"" and that would be a cool name for it, or anything else of my choice.
Maybe feminism is a valid name for an equality movement, but then I don't believe it to be the optimal name for one."

I picked the hottest chick in the lineup. But when I got her naked, I’m 99% sure I saw a collection of warts around her perineum and lower labia. But tequila is a helluva drink, and we had done a good bit of blow, so I fucked her anyway. Whoops! I didn’t get to take a shower until the next day. No hpv."

And yes, I definitely agree on books providing a similar knowledge path as forms or curriculum in karate (we actually don't call them kata lol, but I learned that word in the past year from talking to martial artists from around the country, so I understood!), and you made a good argument for it (your writing style), so emotionally I am inclined to agree because your description was vivid and exciting, but logically I am wondering if you have really changed my view. Basically, you made an argument for how reading can enrich my life in a similar way to the other things I already do."

&gt; Have you ever played one of those collectible card games? Bought a pack of cards, ripped it open, added them to your deck? Annihilation is a foil-wrapped booster pack for weird fiction, loaded with truly original images. Truly original entities.
The book is pretty weird. But the set pieces of the story are a hoist into new *kinds* of stories, which are also new ways of thinking. They're a shortcut into thinking about things you haven't thought about before."

125,t3_2ww2gf,"I am stuck in a rut at my current job and need to do something about it. I want to actually do something I feel like I can make a difference with (I really want to be a vet) but I grew up in a household where money was always tight and learned to not bite off more than I can chew. Being in a debt and owing people money is a huge deal to me and I try to avoid it at all costs.

I wasn't to go to school to be a vet but I feel like it will only make things worse by piling on student debts or not being able to find a job in my field (or both). How accurate is this assumption?



**EDIT: I thank you all for replying to this topic. I honestly wasnt expecting to change the profession but looking at these posts and knowing myself, I would be better suited to studying to be a VET TECH and enroll at community college for the first couple of years and transfer.  I am 26 living in Utah and have put off doing any sort of higher education just based on the whole debt/job field issue but I am going to start making some changes and speak to some career advisors at SLCC (the local community college here) and get started. 
I cant thank you all enough for all the advice given to me!!**

126,t1_counjd7_1,"A college education need not always go hand-in-hand with a large amount of student debt. A responsible approach to your education would allow you to achieve your goals without taking out debts that you may be unable to pay back.
That means looking towards other methods to pay for schooling that aren't debt (using funds from work, grants, or scholarships), looking into cheap schooling options (testing out of general education or attending community college), and perhaps even responsible loans based on a realistic analysis of your future earning potential. You could even look at work-study programs or the military as a route to low-debt education."
