1,cyshwie_1,"&gt; Also, bear in mind that many art papers are difficult to read because the authors use excessive jargon and other obfuscating techniques to hide the fact that they actually have a fairly simple point to make
It sounds like you just don't understand art history, and so label it 'easy', to be honest. Do you have any evidence that what you just said is true?"
2,cysm6pl_2,"&gt; ""This essay is about knowledges of space and time that aspire to be global but remain local."" Well that sets us off to a good start. Just add a ""man"" to the end and you have the perfect hippy mumbo jumbo.
This isn't gibberish, you're just ignorant of the discipline and the influences and reference points of the writer. Most notably, Foucault. Anyone who's read and understood Foucault would feel fairly comfortable with a sentence like that, when it's placed in the context of that essay (isolated, I agree, it seems pretty silly)."
3,d165mtu_1,"&gt;But there is a lot less room for confusion about ""pro-abortion"" meaning that they want to force people to get more abortions
You seem pretty confused yourself. Nobody wants abortions to happen. That's why like 98% of what planned parenthood does is *prevent* unwanted pregnancies."
4,d165mtu_2,"People that are pro-choice don't believe people should be forced into anything. Whether or not you have an abortion should be up to you because that's your right as an American.
People that are pro-life *do* want to force peoples' hands. They want to force people to have babies regardless of the whether or not a good home can be provided, which if they really were pro-life should be something they care about."
5,d4hcvk6,"Yes they were intimidating. They were violent and angry. Intimidation isn't terrorism. People use intimidation in business and on the school yard. That does not make everyone terrorists.

I will repeat my statement that the rioters were looking for retribution and ego compensation rather than acting on political ideologies. "
6,d4hdz6j,Your definition of terrorism is way too broad.
7,e6clcvs_4,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
8,e6clcvs_5,"Now you might ask .... how could K (or anyone) ever have a chance against random accusations?  Well, an accusation from a woman who never knew him or never moved in his social circle would be ignored.  An accusation with no past corroborating evidence (therapist notes, witnesses) would have much less value.    An accusation by a person with a history of false accusations or mental illness would be downplayed.  Heck,  George Bush was accused of raping some nutty woman, but it was obvious that she and he had never come into proximity, so it was laughed off except by conspiracy sites."
9,e6csi4d,In the therapist notes she never mentions kavanaugh at all she vaguely mentions she was sexually assaulted by 3 people. Now she is saying Kavanaugh and 1 other person is responsible. To even say this case has strong evidence would be a massive exaggeration. Your other point such as Kav’s friend has a history of inebriation is some of the stupidest attempts at “evidence” I have ever seen. This case has no merit especially since ford refuses to even accuse him under oath and Kavanaugh should be treated as innocent until substantial evidence comes out (which it won’t since it was 30 years ago).
10,e6d3cso_5,"“Sure, we can’t *show* s/he’s not ethically immaculate, but we’ve brought doubt on it and you can’t demonstrate s/he is!”"
11,e6d3v4s_2,"You need a certain improbable level of crazy to concoct an assault, then you need to get get *really really improbable* and have this improbably crazy accuser already have been assaulted by somebody perfectly fitting K's description.
Improbable is approximately the same as implausible.  The simple and more probable explanation is that she's telling the truth."
12,e6d4v67_1,"&gt;Only a very small fraction...
There’s a very good reason that statistical arguments don’t hold up in court. They’re totally invalid as stand-alone arguments because they don’t *actually* demonstrate anything. You can’t apply it in an individual case because reality isn’t a big dice game where you can say, “Okay, she made a rape accusation, and 99.5% of them are true. Let’s roll the 200-sided die to decide this one!”"
13,e6d4v67_5,"I mean, *statistically*, I, as a black man, am much more likely to be killed by another black man in this country. So as a prosecutor, would you look at the jury and say “Statistically, it’s much more likely that the defendant committed this murder because he is black, and that makes it *more likely* that he’s guilty than that suspect #2 is guilty.”"
14,e6d4v67_6,"I guess you wouldn’t, but from a statistical standpoint, that argument is just as valid as the one you made.
And hell, if I continue to play devil’s advocate, that might make it even more likely; Ford’s a smart social scientist who undoubtedly *knows* this statistic that you’ve given, and she understands psychology, so she knows that statistical arguments can have a lot of power, and that will play into her hand."
15,e6d69zl_1,"&gt; But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school,
OK, Perry Mason. I see we're dealing with an expert."
16,e6d69zl_2,"&gt;  and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted;
This *ISN'T A COURT CASE*, Mr. Lionel Hutz.  Put your pelican back in your briefs."
17,dbrj3ub_1,"Most anti-feminists would become even more anti-feminist if they actually knew what is was.
&gt; most anti-feminists have either no, or a distorted, idea of what feminism actually is
I think most recognize that feminism is the promotion for women's rights/promotion for the consumerist interests of women."
18,dbrj3ub_2,"&gt; most anti-feminists have no idea of the realities of being a woman
That's true; men don't know what is like to work a dead end job for 30 years before waking up one morning and feeding your cat at which point you realize you utterly wasted your life. Men don't know what it is like to feel so emotionally broken that the only way you conjure life temporarily back to your permanently dead body is to be defiled by peoples who names escape you. Men don't know what it is like to have such a void in heart emotionally that the only thing of fucking meaning you can do in your life is go protest to let Muhammad into your country so maybe, just maybe, one of them is hot and rapes you in a back ally somewhere. Men don't know what it is like to be so confused by the culture that they think being objectified sexually is wrong, but getting gangbang Dp'd by 5 black dudes is ""liberating""."
19,dbrj3ub_3,"Most men have no idea how utterly pointless and and meaningless life is  for women since feminism took hold. Indeed they have they're facing problems of their own sexually, but at least they still live the life most accommodating to them overall.
&gt; most anti-feminists simply don’t understand women, period
Indeed, but then again who truly does? The evolutionary differences are remarkable and with with lots of research it still confuses me at times."
20,dbrj3ub_4,"&gt;  Rather, it is addresses the very real issues women still face on a daily basis.
Well, it's certainly about addressing issues women face, by making them worse."
21,dbrlwus_1,"This is exactly the type of condescending comment I'd expect from a subreddit like this. You can't argue at an intellectual level (not to be overly self aggrandizing) so you try to make personal attacks.
I'm not saying I'm not depressed, but what does that even have to do with anything? We live in a society that is complete and utter rot, evil is good and good is evil. It stands to reason that anyone who doesn't accept this would feel alienated. Even those that do accept it are extremely alienated, that is what the whole culture is setup to do: break people."
22,dbrlwus_2,[This quote comes to mind](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/77/db/f4/77dbf4fe2dec8885472654968171be15.jpg).
23,dbrmue8_1,"I mostly agree but I'm more like a Taoist who believes in eternal ideas that bring the most harmony so ""reactionary"" isn't a label I think suits me even if thats what the Marxists will call me.
One of those eternal ideas is that men and women are different, not just slightly different but yin/yang different. The best thing to do is let their differences flourish and that brings harmony."
24,de9sp4o,"No. I just don't like it when people, on any sub, post a video of a guy hitting a woman because she called him a shit head, with hundreds of comments commending the man and calling it equal rights."
25,de9wr2x_1,"&gt; I just don't like it when people, on any sub, post a video of a guy hitting a woman because she called him a shit head, with hundreds of comments commending the man and calling it equal rights.
Can you post a link to the posting of this video, because my guess is that you've either misinterpreted it, or misrepresented it."
26,de9wr2x_2,"A video of a man hitting a woman (or anyone hitting anyone) because they called them a shit head would get soundly condemned and downvoted on reddit.
A video of a man defending himself against a woman who physically attacked him would receive a significant amount of support (and some condemnation) on reddit.  That's not misogyny, that's equality."
27,d85vi9n_1,"I understand that this is your impression of feminists, but how on Earth are you able to know that ""most feminists"" feel this way?
&gt; Feminists want equal pay, but do not want equal representation when it comes to workplace fatalities and employment in ""dirty jobs"" such as sewage maintenance or waste management.
I'm confused. Women aren't allowed equal pay at desk jobs because they are disproportionately employed at other jobs? I, as a man, deserve more money at my desk job because other men serve shitty jobs that I choose not to? I am so confused."
28,d85vi9n_2,"&gt; Feminists are okay with the status quo of the extreme advantage they receive in practically all aspects of the legal system. Less prison time for the same crimes, advantages in custody disputes, extreme biases in child molestation cases, etc..
Where did you get this idea from? That feminists are ""ok"" with this?"
29,d85vi9n_3,"&gt; Most feminists forget that while women had to metaphorically fight for the right to vote in the past, a majority of men literally had to fight (through military service) for the right to vote. Women's suffrage was about earning the right to vote while avoiding the burdens that came along with that right.
So, because women did not have to physically fight for the right to vote, they are somehow dodging fighting responsibilities? How can you say this when feminists have worked so hard to allow women to join the military? It's men that have kept women out of the military."
30,d85vi9n_5,"&gt; Feminists don't like the objectifation of women in media, but find objectifaction of men in the media to be acceptable.
Where do you see that feminists think this is ok? I know many feminists who hate Trump to the core but still stand up against ridiculing him through small penis and small hand comments. Objectification continues to happen, and does happen to men, but it is disproportionately targeted towards women and feminists usually focus on women's issues related to it. Is it that they don't also publicly talk about men's issues that they ""don't care"""
31,d85y4rt_2,"&gt;Gender stereotypes are portrayed as a women's issue by only speaking of the negative ones associated to women.
[You'll find this poster is incredibly popular in, you guessed it, Feminist circles](https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-every-girl-every-boy)"
32,d85z3im_1,"For the record, i don't consider myself a MRA
In the idiot dad context, yes you are correct. However there are other examples: The rape of men is considered to be humorous, while the rape of women is not (EG - the rape scene in Wedding Crashers, ""don't drop the soap"").
It's just an example of gender roles and/or stereotypes that both genders endure. MRAs are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to men, and feminists are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to women."
33,d85z3im_2,"It isn't common in either group for them to discuss gender roles/stereotypes outside of the ""attack on gender X"" box."
34,d85zj9e_3,"It's easy to think that maybe MRA's and Feminists are just mirror images of each other, but they're not, not even close. Feminism has a century-old academic tradition that has exposed more of how sexism affects men than anyone else, especially MRA's. It's a natural conclusion from ""femininity isn't bad"" that men who don't fully exhibit so-called ""masculinity"" (e.g. male stereotypes) should not be socially punished. Feminists are also *usually* against gender essentialism, the idea that your sex inherently imbues you with certain characteristics, and so expectations of those characteristics are unfair. Given that MRA's have such a high crossover with TRP, an explicitly gender-essentialist group, their treatment of these issues shouldn't be surprising."
35,d864huv_3,"Look at it via a real-world example: let's say you're a female nursing school graduate, and you just got your license. You're on google looking around for nursing jobs, and you find some literature that says that [female nurses get paid less than male nurses even across every controllable variable](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2208795) regarding hours worked, experience level, specialty, etc. You think to yourself ""this is bullshit, I deserve equal pay for equal work,"" so you sign up for some mailing lists and donate to the NOW PAC. Is this a bad faith act because it doesn't also address the prevalence of men in hazardous jobs or lack of healthcare funding for combat veterans?"
36,d86bzje_1,"&gt;It's not implied though, and this is fine. When people donate to these causes there is no expectation that the money is going towards curing all forms of cancer. Those and other groups are very clear on what their goal is, and don't misrepresent themselves.
You don't think it's clear enough that the National Organization for Women is an organization intended to address inequalities which affect women?"
37,d86bzje_2,"&gt;Feminism's goal is to advance the status of women, but often the claim is that they seek equality.
The two are not mutually exclusive. There are many ways today in which women are socially and economically disadvantaged, or in other words, not equal. Addressing these issues simultaneously advances the status of women and creates a more equal society."
38,d86cm12_2,"If my dream is to be a cement worker, it's pretty great to be male. If my dream is to run a daycare center, it's going to suck to be male. If I happen to be getting sentenced for murder, I'd do just about anything to be female rather than male."
39,d86dx8t_1,"&gt;I think where we disagree is probably on our views of what equality means in this context. My view is that women already have social, political, and economic equality to men.
This is demonstrably untrue in many ways. There's an enormous amount of evidence for things like pay disparity (even controlling for choice of work, hours, experience, etc), rates of sexual assault, reproductive rights, healthcare costs, and on and on. But even if it weren't:"
40,d86dx8t_2,"&gt;Firstly, there are no longer any laws in our country that are sexist.
So? Is violent crime no longer an issue because it's already illegal?"
41,d86dx8t_3,"&gt;Secondly, whether one is born female or male, that person will have arbitrary burdens and advantages placed upon them simply because of their gender. This happens to both genders, and thus both genders are equal. The inequity only occurs based upon the situation one finds themselves in.
This is a false equivalence. You can't just say that gender equality already exists because men and women both have problems. Gender equality isn't a state where both genders are equally subject to social bias, it's a state where neither gender is. The removal of any one destructive effect of gender roles/standards/biases is a step towards equality, it's not promoting inequality because it doesn't somehow annihilate a commensurate amount of bias towards the opposite sex. It's not a zero-sum proposition. Women being less screwed doesn't somehow reduce the stature of men in society."
42,d86dx8t_4,"&gt;If my dream is to be a cement worker, it's pretty great to be male. If my dream is to run a daycare center, it's going to suck to be male. If I happen to be getting sentenced for murder, I'd do just about anything to be female rather than male.
All of these things suck. They're all bad. If you eliminated any one of these biases it would create a more equal world regardless of whether or not any of the others were also solved."
43,d86dx8t_5,"&gt;To just use objectification for example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""of women"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude the male gender from the argument against objectification.
Why? Explain how that's different from: ""To use cancer as an example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""colon"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude all non-colon cancers from the effort to cure cancer."""
44,t3_2qr8gn,"""There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal, but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that ""sex with another person = relationship over"" that I don't think hold up.

 * **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 * **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. 

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. CMV!

45,t1_cn9b5po_6,"I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. You have every reason to break up.
In my mind, marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers? Why should you stay married?"
46,t3_24c5qv,"""I know this is a frequent topic, but I really want to have my View changed. The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora

47,t3_1v2buu,"""I recently got into an argument on reddit about the esteem polyglots are held in. It's my opinion that polyglotism is pretty much useless and not worth the amount of time and brain-power that needs to be devoted to becoming a polyglot. I understand that maybe there is some benefit to academia from it, I can see it being useful in cases where some language has died out and left behind an ancient, potentially significant text and having a knowledge of how languages generally work could be beneficial to understanding and translating that text. But I think that speaking 12 languages is just peacocking and hasn't much use.

I have no idea if there is some nuance to the application of rules. But I'm just supposed to know these things.

First, ever culture has their own unspoken rules regarding physical contact.  I was raised in a touch-conservative family and in a touch-conservative culture (certain region of America where hugging people who aren't close to you isn't done).  I expect a certain amount of personal space in a public area and especially between strangers.  I do not want, nor do I expect, a stranger to be comfortable hugging me.  I am a petite build.  If a larger man or woman comes in and violates my personal space - and it is a violation - that is a rattling experience because I am not used to it, it is not culturally appropriate, and my body is not yours to treat however you want."
61,dlu7qbe_4,"Body language is interpreted by different people in different ways and is definitely not consent for another person to touch you.  A person who wants to hug another is more likely to misinterpret signals or, again disrespect the individual who does not want to be hugged.
Your desire to hug does is not important enough to violate another person's body.  If you want a hug, you can use body language to communicate that you want to engage in a hug without touching the person, thus respecting the person and their body enough to let them choose if they want to engage in the hug.  Or you can just ask them.  The onus shouldn't be on the person you wish to hug."
62,dluaddo_1,"It's not different with women.  I even stated in my initial post that a woman doing this makes me uncomfortable.  This is my body.  It is not your body.

63,dluaddo_2,"How do you realistically telegraph that you want to hug someone?  I think it's unreasonable that you're asking me that, but you expect someone to use body language to communicate that they do NOT want a hug.  If you don't know a person well enough to use your body language to clearly communicate your desire to hug them, then as I originally posted, you should ASK.  Use your words.

68,d5djkpf,"&gt; The free market will absolutely dictate that this kind of arrangement will inevitably evolve into preferential partnerships

It will also dictate that if people have a problem with it, then another company can easily dominate the market simply by NOT offering preferential bandwidth.  "
69,d5dlw81_1,"And we as consumers have a shared interest in not letting that happen, not by demanding that the government just force them to do what we want, but by having enough spine to put our money where our mouths are.
If anyone has a problem with what T-Mobile is doing with Pokemon Go, they should be on the phone right now canceling their contract and signing up with Sprint."
70,d5doh4e_2,"And let's be clear, they aren't withholding some service or product that is necessary for life.  We're talking about not charging people for data they are using to play Pokemon.  Even in the cases where you have a true NEED for something, I have serious issues with telling people how to manage their own resources, but talking about doing it for Pokemon is just absurd."
71,d5dq7v0_1,"I completely agree.  That's causing direct harm to unwilling parties who (and this part is key) have literally ZERO choice in the matter.  You can't simply choose not to exist in the environment, therefore they are putting you in direct harm's way, so yes, it's appropriate to regulate that.
Making Netflix slower for you is not harming you."
72,d5dqk5x_1,"It's harming other businesses. It's harming the economy. You are acting like businesses operate in a vacuum. They have the opportunity to operate because with have a complex civilization including public works like water, electricity, police, firemen, roads, customers who have access to medical care etc etc etc.
My concern is that you want it both ways. You want businesses to be able to do whatever they want to do, but also have access to all those things that our government and society has created.  If your business practices threaten to monopolize an entire industry or form cartels in those industries, like steel, railroad, power, and Internet, that can easily hurt our societies consumers, how is it unethical for society to get together and do something about that?"
73,d5dqk5x_2,"Look, the positives and negatives of regulations can be argued, but when it comes to collusion and monopolizing there really isn't much of an argument. It hurts the consumer, it hurts competing businesses, and it's bad for the economy."
74,d5dqxme_1,"To reiterate, we are talking about T-Mobile (one of four choices that literally EVERYONE has) letting people play Pokemon without charging them for data, and you are talking about a monopoly on steel.
I don't want it both ways.  I want it that first way.  I want businesses to do as they see fit with their resources, just like I want to be able to do for myself.  You're acting like all this great stuff couldn't exist without the government."
75,d0bz6bp_4,"&gt;""It's what we've always done"" - Literally not an argument. Until 100 years ago we hadn't figured out basic hygiene standards in hospitals.
Let's formulate it bit better. Our genes developed before the agricultural revolution. Our bodies are literally programed to function effectively on the diet consisting of meat. Problems such as diabetes, heart problems, obesity wasn't an issue until we started to grow crops, process sugar and salt. Our body simply doesn't work in an optimal way to adjust for those factors as of yet."
76,d0c6fn4,"&gt; Because our body doesn't know how to function properly without meat.

78,d0cnzdi_2,"assessment of dietary adequacy essential
And it says that over and over again.
""nutritionally balanced diet"", etc...
Why do you think it is that way. Because if you eat a garbage sausage you get all the essential nutrients. If you eat apple, you won't.
You even have a page long section about how you can get balance the diet. Mostly telling you how to get majority of essential nutrients from dairy and other animal products."
79,d0coqd9_2,"Can you get the same effect with combination of vegetabes, fruits and dairy? Yes.
Could a vegan get it without acces to those (for example dairies)? No.
Can a carnivore with acces only to 1 kind of meat? Yes.
Hence my statement."

82,dhwdu6i_2,An advanced AI trying to achieve total equity between all individuals would suffer from the same existential collapse as an organization of humans.  Crushing the natural human order (a hierarchy - check out the chimps) into a totally flat equality of outcomes and statuses will not end well.  Enforcing that will inevitably become a cruel and destructive totalitarian regime of inhumanity - regardless of government waste.
83,dhwe8om,"Ha, capitalism balances resources for best use and maximum productivity? Have you heard of the capitalist concept of planned obsolescence? Capitalism is full of waste and inefficiencies as long as it's profitable to the powerful."
84,dhwgz26_2,"It's fine and well to criticize the capitalist paradigm for being unfair and wasteful, but if you can't show that it's more wasteful than your alternative, all you're really doing is whining.

86,e2f1am8,"Okay, but since we are talking about this so-called 'study'. Maybe you wanna discuss that instead of something entirely besides the point?"
87,t3_340hb6,"You see a of this attitude on Tumblr, Facebook, and other social media. Slowly it went from almost exclusively online, to now being more prominent and accepted in the real world. 

With this new brand of activism and ""acceptance"" it seems as though if you're not attracted to every single variance of the opposite/same sex, you're labeled an asshole, shallow, transphobic, racist, or any other less than favorable terms. I feel it is wrong to berate, reprimand, or otherwise harass people who take preference in their sexual/romantic partners. 

An example of this is the ""fat acceptance"" movement. I'm attracted to petite women. I don't know why, I just am. I have thus far, never been attracted to an obese woman, as I don't find that body type attractive. My attraction/preference isn't anyone else's business other than my own, and no one should be entitled to me.  The same goes for attraction based on any other variable. CMV."
