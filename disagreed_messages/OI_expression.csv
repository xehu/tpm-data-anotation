Gee, somebody should've told that to Steve Jobs when he came up with the iPhone. ""Hey Steve, your idea is shit because this phone is non-durable and its battery life sucks!""

3,cysac2e_2,"Also, bear in mind that many art papers are difficult to read because the authors use excessive jargon and other obfuscating techniques to hide the fact that they actually have a fairly simple point to make.

People that are pro-life *do* want to force peoples' hands. They want to force people to have babies regardless of the whether or not a good home can be provided, which if they really were pro-life should be something they care about."
10,d4hcl84,"&gt; I don't think they were trying to coerce anyone politically

You don't think intimidation of Trump supporters was a motive in any cases?"
11,d4hcon6_2,"&gt;They were just being assholes.
Well, acts of terrorism are one way to be an asshole. So in any event, I don't disagree."
12,d4hcvk6,"Yes they were intimidating. They were violent and angry. Intimidation isn't terrorism. People use intimidation in business and on the school yard. That does not make everyone terrorists.

I will repeat my statement that the rioters were looking for retribution and ego compensation rather than acting on political ideologies. "
13,d4hd9kk_1,"&gt; Intimidation isn't terrorism.
The post clearly references the FBI's definition of terrorism as the operative one for the discussion. Quoting it with my own emphasis: ""the unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property **to intimidate** or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives."""
14,d4hd9kk_2,"So, I have to disagree. According to this definition, that's terrorism.
&gt;People use intimidation in business and on the school yard.
Political violence is treated differently than disputes over individual or small-scale economic or social concerns. When violence is used to intimidate political opposition, it strikes at the very core fundament of big-d Democracy itself. It has to be treated with the utmost seriousness."
15,d4hdz6j,Your definition of terrorism is way too broad.
16,d4he2iq,"""My"" definition is straight off the National Institute of Justice website, referring to the definition that the Federal Bureau of Investigation uses. I think that's a pretty solid source, but feel free to suggest a better one."
17,dzh0psx_2,"Although I appreciate your first two logical statements, (as I am a reasonable guy), your third comment is why I believe we need a higher emphasis on philosophy in our education system."
18,e6clcvs_4,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
19,e6clcvs_5,"Now you might ask .... how could K (or anyone) ever have a chance against random accusations?  Well, an accusation from a woman who never knew him or never moved in his social circle would be ignored.  An accusation with no past corroborating evidence (therapist notes, witnesses) would have much less value.    An accusation by a person with a history of false accusations or mental illness would be downplayed.  Heck,  George Bush was accused of raping some nutty woman, but it was obvious that she and he had never come into proximity, so it was laughed off except by conspiracy sites."
20,e6csi4d,In the therapist notes she never mentions kavanaugh at all she vaguely mentions she was sexually assaulted by 3 people. Now she is saying Kavanaugh and 1 other person is responsible. To even say this case has strong evidence would be a massive exaggeration. Your other point such as Kav’s friend has a history of inebriation is some of the stupidest attempts at “evidence” I have ever seen. This case has no merit especially since ford refuses to even accuse him under oath and Kavanaugh should be treated as innocent until substantial evidence comes out (which it won’t since it was 30 years ago).
21,e6d3cso_3,"If someone believes hard enough that conservatives are evil and do not deserve power, why hesitate to use *any means possible* to stop him?
Hell, we need not even go *that* far. What if, even if K did *not* assault her, she still feels like his moral character is in question based on *other* experiences with him? Maybe she’s willing to use whatever means necessary to stop someone who isn’t “demonstrably ethically immaculate,” as you say, from being appointed for the foreseeable future?"
22,e6d3cso_5,"“Sure, we can’t *show* s/he’s not ethically immaculate, but we’ve brought doubt on it and you can’t demonstrate s/he is!”"
23,e6d3v4s_2,"You need a certain improbable level of crazy to concoct an assault, then you need to get get *really really improbable* and have this improbably crazy accuser already have been assaulted by somebody perfectly fitting K's description.
Improbable is approximately the same as implausible.  The simple and more probable explanation is that she's telling the truth."
24,e6d4v67_1,"&gt;Only a very small fraction...
There’s a very good reason that statistical arguments don’t hold up in court. They’re totally invalid as stand-alone arguments because they don’t *actually* demonstrate anything. You can’t apply it in an individual case because reality isn’t a big dice game where you can say, “Okay, she made a rape accusation, and 99.5% of them are true. Let’s roll the 200-sided die to decide this one!”"
25,e6d4v67_3,"If you were a prosecutor in those cases, would you argue that only a small minority of accusations are lies, and that that should be another reason to convict? What if, 20, 30, 40 years later, the defendant is released because of backlogged DNA evidence that exonerates him - would you stand by that argument? If it were me, I would feel very guilty. I’ve done nothing illegal, but I’d feel as though I’d committed prosecutorial misconduct."
26,e6d4v67_5,"I mean, *statistically*, I, as a black man, am much more likely to be killed by another black man in this country. So as a prosecutor, would you look at the jury and say “Statistically, it’s much more likely that the defendant committed this murder because he is black, and that makes it *more likely* that he’s guilty than that suspect #2 is guilty.”"
27,e6d4v67_6,"I guess you wouldn’t, but from a statistical standpoint, that argument is just as valid as the one you made.
And hell, if I continue to play devil’s advocate, that might make it even more likely; Ford’s a smart social scientist who undoubtedly *knows* this statistic that you’ve given, and she understands psychology, so she knows that statistical arguments can have a lot of power, and that will play into her hand."
28,e6d4v67_7,"Again, I don’t know anything about Ford personally, so this isn’t an accusation. But from where I stand, there’s nothing to tip the scales of probability in either direction absent actual substantial evidence. That’s why I think we should focus on that kind of evidence.
&gt;straw-woman
No, because I’m not actually attributing this to her. As I said, it’s an alternative explanation with nothing inherently wrong with it. And by the way, I wrote a second paragraph that had *another* alternative explanation that you didn’t address. It’s not like my scenario hinges on her being a crazy hardcore liberal. She could just be someone who believes that the ends justify the means, I suppose. But again, I don’t know, and I’m not saying that *any* of this is actually true. But we also don’t know that *your* explanation is true."
29,e6d69zl_1,"&gt; But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school,
OK, Perry Mason. I see we're dealing with an expert."
30,e6d69zl_2,"&gt;  and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted;
This *ISN'T A COURT CASE*, Mr. Lionel Hutz.  Put your pelican back in your briefs."
31,e6d6hj8_2,"&gt;This ISN’T A COURT CASE
Inconsistent. Very unbecoming of someone making an argument."
32,e6d6hj8_3,"Either it’s okay to bring court-based concepts into arguments that aren’t about court cases (as ***you*** did before), or it’s not okay (as you criticized ***me*** for doing). You can pick one - not both - but you’re being inconsistent either way. That is, unless you admit that I’ve changed your view on something (“however minor,” pursuant to sidebar rules)."
33,dbrj3ub_1,"Most anti-feminists would become even more anti-feminist if they actually knew what is was.
&gt; most anti-feminists have either no, or a distorted, idea of what feminism actually is
I think most recognize that feminism is the promotion for women's rights/promotion for the consumerist interests of women."
34,dbrj3ub_2,"&gt; most anti-feminists have no idea of the realities of being a woman
That's true; men don't know what is like to work a dead end job for 30 years before waking up one morning and feeding your cat at which point you realize you utterly wasted your life. Men don't know what it is like to feel so emotionally broken that the only way you conjure life temporarily back to your permanently dead body is to be defiled by peoples who names escape you. Men don't know what it is like to have such a void in heart emotionally that the only thing of fucking meaning you can do in your life is go protest to let Muhammad into your country so maybe, just maybe, one of them is hot and rapes you in a back ally somewhere. Men don't know what it is like to be so confused by the culture that they think being objectified sexually is wrong, but getting gangbang Dp'd by 5 black dudes is ""liberating""."
35,dbrj3ub_3,"Most men have no idea how utterly pointless and and meaningless life is  for women since feminism took hold. Indeed they have they're facing problems of their own sexually, but at least they still live the life most accommodating to them overall.
&gt; most anti-feminists simply don’t understand women, period
Indeed, but then again who truly does? The evolutionary differences are remarkable and with with lots of research it still confuses me at times."
36,dbrj3ub_4,"&gt;  Rather, it is addresses the very real issues women still face on a daily basis.
Well, it's certainly about addressing issues women face, by making them worse."
37,dbrlkqg,"Dude, you sound depressed.  I think you might want to look into some professional help.  I really wish you peace and happiness.  "
38,dbrlwus_1,"This is exactly the type of condescending comment I'd expect from a subreddit like this. You can't argue at an intellectual level (not to be overly self aggrandizing) so you try to make personal attacks.
I'm not saying I'm not depressed, but what does that even have to do with anything? We live in a society that is complete and utter rot, evil is good and good is evil. It stands to reason that anyone who doesn't accept this would feel alienated. Even those that do accept it are extremely alienated, that is what the whole culture is setup to do: break people."

41,dbrmue8_1,"I mostly agree but I'm more like a Taoist who believes in eternal ideas that bring the most harmony so ""reactionary"" isn't a label I think suits me even if thats what the Marxists will call me.
One of those eternal ideas is that men and women are different, not just slightly different but yin/yang different. The best thing to do is let their differences flourish and that brings harmony."

Can you post a link to the posting of this video, because my guess is that you've either misinterpreted it, or misrepresented it."
45,de9wr2x_2,"A video of a man hitting a woman (or anyone hitting anyone) because they called them a shit head would get soundly condemned and downvoted on reddit.
A video of a man defending himself against a woman who physically attacked him would receive a significant amount of support (and some condemnation) on reddit.  That's not misogyny, that's equality."
46,d85vi9n_1,"I understand that this is your impression of feminists, but how on Earth are you able to know that ""most feminists"" feel this way?
&gt; Feminists want equal pay, but do not want equal representation when it comes to workplace fatalities and employment in ""dirty jobs"" such as sewage maintenance or waste management.
I'm confused. Women aren't allowed equal pay at desk jobs because they are disproportionately employed at other jobs? I, as a man, deserve more money at my desk job because other men serve shitty jobs that I choose not to? I am so confused."
47,d85vi9n_2,"&gt; Feminists are okay with the status quo of the extreme advantage they receive in practically all aspects of the legal system. Less prison time for the same crimes, advantages in custody disputes, extreme biases in child molestation cases, etc..
Where did you get this idea from? That feminists are ""ok"" with this?"
48,d85vi9n_3,"&gt; Most feminists forget that while women had to metaphorically fight for the right to vote in the past, a majority of men literally had to fight (through military service) for the right to vote. Women's suffrage was about earning the right to vote while avoiding the burdens that came along with that right.
So, because women did not have to physically fight for the right to vote, they are somehow dodging fighting responsibilities? How can you say this when feminists have worked so hard to allow women to join the military? It's men that have kept women out of the military."
49,d85vi9n_4,"&gt; Feminists are concerned with online sexual harassment, but don't seem as concerned with online death threats (primary directed towards men), and don't appear to consider that only men are 'swatted'.
Many online feminists receive death threats, this is hardly a symptom that is unfairly targeting men."
50,d85vi9n_5,"&gt; Feminists don't like the objectifation of women in media, but find objectifaction of men in the media to be acceptable.
Where do you see that feminists think this is ok? I know many feminists who hate Trump to the core but still stand up against ridiculing him through small penis and small hand comments. Objectification continues to happen, and does happen to men, but it is disproportionately targeted towards women and feminists usually focus on women's issues related to it. Is it that they don't also publicly talk about men's issues that they ""don't care"""
51,d85y4rt_2,"&gt;Gender stereotypes are portrayed as a women's issue by only speaking of the negative ones associated to women.
[You'll find this poster is incredibly popular in, you guessed it, Feminist circles](https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-every-girl-every-boy)"
52,d85z3im_1,"For the record, i don't consider myself a MRA
In the idiot dad context, yes you are correct. However there are other examples: The rape of men is considered to be humorous, while the rape of women is not (EG - the rape scene in Wedding Crashers, ""don't drop the soap"").
It's just an example of gender roles and/or stereotypes that both genders endure. MRAs are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to men, and feminists are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to women."
53,d85z3im_2,"It isn't common in either group for them to discuss gender roles/stereotypes outside of the ""attack on gender X"" box."
54,d85zj9e_3,"It's easy to think that maybe MRA's and Feminists are just mirror images of each other, but they're not, not even close. Feminism has a century-old academic tradition that has exposed more of how sexism affects men than anyone else, especially MRA's. It's a natural conclusion from ""femininity isn't bad"" that men who don't fully exhibit so-called ""masculinity"" (e.g. male stereotypes) should not be socially punished. Feminists are also *usually* against gender essentialism, the idea that your sex inherently imbues you with certain characteristics, and so expectations of those characteristics are unfair. Given that MRA's have such a high crossover with TRP, an explicitly gender-essentialist group, their treatment of these issues shouldn't be surprising."
55,d864huv_1,"Your reasoning isn't incorrect, but you're holding specific groups to unreasonable standards. Putting aside the point that feminism isn't a homogeneous group of views and doesn't have any 'official' spokespeople, there are a few reasons why this is the case:
&gt;Thus, when I see a feminist discussing gender roles and how the impact women, I conclude that they are only concerned with women being in gender roles. It'd be one thing if the argument began with ""we're going to focus on gender roles that impact woman"" or something similar, but in my experience this isn't common.
Why can't this be implied? When you see a poster that says ""5k To Cure Colon Cancer"", do you expect it to say ""We recognize and appreciate that colon cancer is not the only cancer, and that prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and a litany of non-cancerous illnesses are all horrible diseases in their own right. However, as an organization started by and for patients, families, and loved ones affected specifically by colon, we are specifically attempting to raise money for colon cancer."" If they don't, are they only concerned with improving the status of colon cancer patients and therefore selfishly disregarding the plight of lymphoma survivors?"
56,d864huv_2,"&gt;It doesn't make sense to me to discuss gender roles and only mention ones that impact a certain gender. I don't see how this helps change or resolve the problem. I don't even get why it's something feminists or MRAs would talk about if they were concerned about ending gender roles. If someone discusses gender roles, and only mentions a single gender, then I think it's reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end gender roles, but rather they want to change them to be more beneficial towards a specific gender.
Again, if someone discusses curing cancer and only mentions a single type of cancer, is it reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end cancer, but rather they want to change the landscape of medical research funding to be more beneficial towards a specific cancer?"
57,d864huv_3,"Look at it via a real-world example: let's say you're a female nursing school graduate, and you just got your license. You're on google looking around for nursing jobs, and you find some literature that says that [female nurses get paid less than male nurses even across every controllable variable](http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2208795) regarding hours worked, experience level, specialty, etc. You think to yourself ""this is bullshit, I deserve equal pay for equal work,"" so you sign up for some mailing lists and donate to the NOW PAC. Is this a bad faith act because it doesn't also address the prevalence of men in hazardous jobs or lack of healthcare funding for combat veterans?"
58,d86bzje_1,"&gt;It's not implied though, and this is fine. When people donate to these causes there is no expectation that the money is going towards curing all forms of cancer. Those and other groups are very clear on what their goal is, and don't misrepresent themselves.
You don't think it's clear enough that the National Organization for Women is an organization intended to address inequalities which affect women?"
59,d86bzje_2,"&gt;Feminism's goal is to advance the status of women, but often the claim is that they seek equality.
The two are not mutually exclusive. There are many ways today in which women are socially and economically disadvantaged, or in other words, not equal. Addressing these issues simultaneously advances the status of women and creates a more equal society."
60,d86cm12_2,"If my dream is to be a cement worker, it's pretty great to be male. If my dream is to run a daycare center, it's going to suck to be male. If I happen to be getting sentenced for murder, I'd do just about anything to be female rather than male."
61,d86dx8t_1,"&gt;I think where we disagree is probably on our views of what equality means in this context. My view is that women already have social, political, and economic equality to men.
This is demonstrably untrue in many ways. There's an enormous amount of evidence for things like pay disparity (even controlling for choice of work, hours, experience, etc), rates of sexual assault, reproductive rights, healthcare costs, and on and on. But even if it weren't:"
62,d86dx8t_2,"&gt;Firstly, there are no longer any laws in our country that are sexist.
So? Is violent crime no longer an issue because it's already illegal?"
63,d86dx8t_3,"&gt;Secondly, whether one is born female or male, that person will have arbitrary burdens and advantages placed upon them simply because of their gender. This happens to both genders, and thus both genders are equal. The inequity only occurs based upon the situation one finds themselves in.
This is a false equivalence. You can't just say that gender equality already exists because men and women both have problems. Gender equality isn't a state where both genders are equally subject to social bias, it's a state where neither gender is. The removal of any one destructive effect of gender roles/standards/biases is a step towards equality, it's not promoting inequality because it doesn't somehow annihilate a commensurate amount of bias towards the opposite sex. It's not a zero-sum proposition. Women being less screwed doesn't somehow reduce the stature of men in society."
64,d86dx8t_4,"&gt;If my dream is to be a cement worker, it's pretty great to be male. If my dream is to run a daycare center, it's going to suck to be male. If I happen to be getting sentenced for murder, I'd do just about anything to be female rather than male.
All of these things suck. They're all bad. If you eliminated any one of these biases it would create a more equal world regardless of whether or not any of the others were also solved."
65,d86dx8t_5,"&gt;To just use objectification for example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""of women"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude the male gender from the argument against objectification.
Why? Explain how that's different from: ""To use cancer as an example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""colon"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude all non-colon cancers from the effort to cure cancer."""
66,t3_2qr8gn,"""There seems to be a commonly held belief that people who cheat on their SO/partner should be dropped immediately with no further contact. I understand that physical/sexual conduct with another person can seem like a betrayal, but in some cases, there are many worse things that can happen in a relationship, which couples seem to be able to work through.

There are a few assumptions underlying the belief that ""sex with another person = relationship over"" that I don't think hold up.

 * **Sex is the most important part of a relationship,** and therefore, betraying it and that agreement mean the relationship should end. My belief: sex is a very important part of a relationship, but not *the* most important part. Immediately breaking up with someone because of something like this seems excessive.

 * **Nobody makes mistakes ever,** so when they do, the relationship should end. My belief: obviously this isn't true, and a cornerstone of strong relationships is the ability to work through mistakes/issues together.

 * **Cheaters will always cheat again,** so better to end it now. my view: That may be true in some cases, but other than anecdotal evidence, I haven't seen anything to support this claim. [But would be really interested in reading anything scientific about this, actually!]

 * **Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship.** My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem. Maybe fixing that issue will resolve the motivation to cheat.

Caveat: sometimes, cheating happens because there are parts of the relationship that are fundamentally broken and/or the relationship is too far gone/unsalvageable and/or this is the straw the broke the camel's back etc. 

Cheating shouldn't always signify an immediate end to a relationship. In some cases, couples can and should choose to work through it. CMV!

Yes. But ""talking about the problem"" is an ideal situation. It often doesn't work out so well that way. People get stuck in a pattern... living in the same house, married to the same person you stopped really caring about. Cheating is evidence that *something* must be wrong."
68,t1_cn9b5po_6,"I point out, cheating has a profound negative emotional effect of the person cheated on. You have every reason to break up.
In my mind, marriage is a commitment. If you break that commitment, the marriage is broken. One partner isn't fulfilling all of his/her obligations (i.e. not to cheat) So why should the other person be obligated to fill out his/hers? Why should you stay married?"
69,t1_cn9b5po_8,"But if you don't break up, you are stuck with a person who doesn't value you enough to stay loyal. Why would you forfeit yourself to such a relationship?

71,t3_24c5qv,"""I know this is a frequent topic, but I really want to have my View changed. The Second Amendment was created with the intent to create a *well regulated* militia to defend from invasion and tyranny. The United States has come a long ways from the 1700's, and no nation could ever invade in this day and age due to the nuclear threat we pose and our massive army. I understand people keeping pistols for self defense, but why would any one need something like an AR-15, which is basically the same gun that the United States Military uses. why would anyone need a weapon like that in our day and age with advanced police forces and military. its not like you are going to be attacked by roving hoards of bandits. A stated reason for the Second Amendment is to resist tyranny, but I don't think that is possible in this day and age, as the modern US military would crush any resistance, as they have the best tanks in the world (try shooting an Abrams) and the best air force. not to mention that few would seriously take up arms in America, as we have it far too good. in the end, i do not believe there is a valid reason for the second amendment, as weapons such as assault rifles are pretty much unnecessary and even a liability, as they have been used for horrible tragedies, such as Sandy Hook and Aurora

72,t3_1v2buu,"""I recently got into an argument on reddit about the esteem polyglots are held in. It's my opinion that polyglotism is pretty much useless and not worth the amount of time and brain-power that needs to be devoted to becoming a polyglot. I understand that maybe there is some benefit to academia from it, I can see it being useful in cases where some language has died out and left behind an ancient, potentially significant text and having a knowledge of how languages generally work could be beneficial to understanding and translating that text. But I think that speaking 12 languages is just peacocking and hasn't much use.

EDIT: I think speaking multiple languages is a good thing but more than 5/6 is for egotistical purposes only, just clarifying as some people seem to think i'm against speaking more than one language"""
73,t1_ceo1051,"I absolutely agree with learning more than one language, I speak english and am competent at two others myself but learning more than say 5/6 is, imo, just an attempt at showing off"
74,t3_1udlql,"By young age, I mean around the time you switch from baths to showers. This of course varies from person to person.

I think that it is Ok to pee in the shower because in theory it saves water. why use the toilet, flush, and then hop in the shower, when you could have so easily used the drain with running water right in front of you?

To address the gross factor, I know there are plenty of people grossed out by this idea, and thats fine. If you don't want to pee in the shower then don't. Nobody is going to force you or anything.

I don't think this behavior should be discouraged because it doesn't hurt anything. In fact, it's efficient, even if just by a little.
