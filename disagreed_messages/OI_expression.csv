1,dp8ayhj_2,"Saying “I’m generally not attracted to native people” is fine because you’re allowing space for the fact that there may in fact be a native person that would be a good fit for you. It’s acknowledging that, while there are **general traits** that are commonly found in native people that you aren’t attracted to, you aren’t discriminating solely on race. Do you see the difference? I know it’s subtle and doesn’t seem important, but it is the key difference between racist/transphobic/discriminatory preferences and non-problematic sexual preferences."
2,t3_30uf3s,"""I used to own a galaxy s2, and currently own a galaxy s4.  My upgrade is almost up, but I see no reason to go with an s6.  

-The difference in performance was noticeable, but on a cost/performance basis it was negligible.  

-I do not see the purpose in the increasingly large resolutions coming to the market.  1440 x 2560, the s6 resolution, is simply unnecessary.  ***EDIT: it seems I was wrong here***

-The upgraded camera features, sensors, etc. are nice, but the number of megapixels has reached its peak, and anyone else who truly cares about the rest will use the $500+ or whatever to actually get themselves a real camera.  

-Many of the nifty little features added to newer versions of cell phones can already be added to old phones, given that the user is even slightly capable of leveraging the app store and/or android community.  I would assume the same can be said of Apple products, but am not as familiar with them.  

I can see significant technological progress being noticeable in the long run, but for now, unless you are coming from a smartphone that is 5+ years old, upgrading to the newest smartphones on the market is a waste of money. Battery life and durability should be the focus of demand from consumers.  Yet, in regards to the s6, battery life is regressing (non-removable, thus cant be replaced as it degrades over time), waterproofing was removed, and even storage is now becoming non-removable.  

I should add a caveat to my CMV: I am not interested in playing the latest games on my phone.

3,cysac2e_1,"I totally agree. I love solving CS problems. I even get that sort of joy from reading *about* CS problems, but that doesn't mean it's easier. It just means that I enjoy working on it more, and I do have some natural aptitude for it. It also doesn't mean that I can't sit through an talk about art. They're usually pretty facile, at least the ones about Egyptian art are. In fact, the same people usually crank out the same talks every year. I could probably tell you in advance what they will be from the scholar's name and the abstract."
4,cysac2e_2,"Also, bear in mind that many art papers are difficult to read because the authors use excessive jargon and other obfuscating techniques to hide the fact that they actually have a fairly simple point to make. I'll take the heat for this claim, but I'm not the first person to make it, and it's pretty obviously true unless you just don't want it to be."

Not really. You're the one who thinks they *ought* to be able to understand anything they read without any prior understanding. It takes a certain level of intellectual hubris to claim that anything you can't understand must be easy to understand or not worth understanding. Besides, you've back-pedalled here: you can't describe what they were saying because you don't understand."

14,d4hd9kk_1,"&gt; Intimidation isn't terrorism.
The post clearly references the FBI's definition of terrorism as the operative one for the discussion.

15,d4hd9kk_2,"So, I have to disagree. According to this definition, that's terrorism.
&gt;People use intimidation in business and on the school yard.
Political violence is treated differently than disputes over individual or small-scale economic or social concerns. When violence is used to intimidate political opposition, it strikes at the very core fundament of big-d Democracy itself. It has to be treated with the utmost seriousness."

18,e6clcvs_3,"It's not felonious to make a statement like this, even if untrue,  but now he has to repeat it under oath, or in effect confess that this was untrue.
&gt; It is possible to believe that something happened to Ford but that something didn’t involve Kavanaugh.
At that point, you can only be arguing mistaken identity.   That's a fair point, but the problem is that Judge was identified as the co-assaulter, and the two guys were buddies (K was mentioned in J's book of wild times under a thin pseudonym O'Kavanaugh).   And it seems they belonged to the same social set - not many opportunities to mess up.  Taking some time to interview students from the era might help nail down their association, and Ford's statements to them at the time."
19,e6clcvs_4,"Suppose that 1) K is consistent and repeats his claim of innocence under oath (otherwise, he's ineligible for the court); 2) You believe 90% that something happened to F; 3) you think there is a  (implausibly high) 40% chance of mistaken identity, despite them apparently moving in the same social circle.  Then, as a spectator, you'd conclude that there is a 54% chance that K committed a felony of perjury.    You would never vote for a person who has a 54% chance of being a felon to the SCOTUS."
20,e6clcvs_5,"Now you might ask .... how could K (or anyone) ever have a chance against random accusations?  Well, an accusation from a woman who never knew him or never moved in his social circle would be ignored.  An accusation with no past corroborating evidence (therapist notes, witnesses) would have much less value.    An accusation by a person with a history of false accusations or mental illness would be downplayed.  Heck,  George Bush was accused of raping some nutty woman, but it was obvious that she and he had never come into proximity, so it was laughed off except by conspiracy sites."
21,e6d3cso_2,"Lightbulb!
She recalls that she discussed in relatively vague detail an assault that she was subjected to at a young age with a therapist, and that she didn’t specify any names. Given their close proximity to one another during school, the fact that he fits the profile for the perpetrators (as do doubtless hundreds of kids who went there, to be fair), and the lack of names given, it’s totally possible to put Kavanaugh’s name onto one of these nameless, faceless criminals and potentially stop his confirmation."
22,e6d3cso_4,"Absent much other evidence, I don’t see any reason why that is inherently less likely than the easy explanation that he’s a predator.
Obviously it’s a case that requires more looking into, and I agree that it’s imperative that we figure out to the best of our abilities what is true and what is not. I just don’t think that “demonstrably ethically immaculate” is a great standard for this. It’s impossible to demonstrate someone’s “ethically immaculate”; the best you can do is show no marks on their record, so to speak. You’re essentially asking to prove a negative - prove he’s never done anything morally suspect - when you use that standard. I don’t think this applies to Kavanaugh, but that standard could easily mean that an accusation with even *the smallest iota* of credibility could rob the country of one of its best, most capable, upstanding jurists."
23,e6d3v4s_1,"&gt; Why do you think taking a real assault and changing the culprit is implausible?
Only a very small fraction of people make false accusations of assault.  The likelihood that anyone  *who knows* you (or me, or Kavanaugh) would do this, probably.  Then only a fraction of people were assaulted, so the potential pool of people to commit this swap-eroo is tiny."
24,e6d3v4s_3,"&gt; If someone believes hard enough that conservatives are evil and do not deserve power,
You're constructing a straw-woman here."
25,e6d4v67_2,"The fact that most assault accusations are true (which in itself is questionable - this isn’t exactly an easy thing to confidently figure out statistically-speaking) I’m sure was very comforting to all the people who’ve had to be exonerated years later because of a false accusation, or those people *still in jail* because we haven’t yet figured out they’re innocent."
26,e6d4v67_4,"The point is that that argument doesn’t actually have any bearing on the likelihood of any particular case being true or false. It’s just an average, really. Even if your average bowling score is 260, there’s still nothing stopping you from throwing eleven gutter-balls. It’s essentially a red herring argument that *pretends* to increase the likelihood of one outcome without actually bringing anything substantive to the table."
27,e6d4v67_5,"I mean, *statistically*, I, as a black man, am much more likely to be killed by another black man in this country. So as a prosecutor, would you look at the jury and say “Statistically, it’s much more likely that the defendant committed this murder because he is black, and that makes it *more likely* that he’s guilty than that suspect #2 is guilty.”"
28,e6d4v67_6,"I guess you wouldn’t, but from a statistical standpoint, that argument is just as valid as the one you made.
And hell, if I continue to play devil’s advocate, that might make it even more likely; Ford’s a smart social scientist who undoubtedly *knows* this statistic that you’ve given, and she understands psychology, so she knows that statistical arguments can have a lot of power, and that will play into her hand."
29,e6d644s_1,"It’s also not a civil case. She’s not suing for damages, she’s casting doubt on the morality of a nominee to office. To my knowledge, it’s not an actual *case* at all. It’s a hearing before the senate. There’s no standard of evidence for such a procedure.
But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school, and another important legal guideline is that out-of-court testimony cannot be used to establish the fact of the matter asserted; that is, you can’t use someone’s testimony that “Ford mentioned Kavanaugh by name to me in 2012” to establish that Ford did indeed mention Kavanaugh by name in 2012. It takes more evidence than that, and it’s an objectionable and inadmissible argument. It’s called hearsay. It wouldn’t be hearsay if Ford’s husband actually testified, but in that case it would only be able to be treated as any other witness testimony given by someone with a clear bias."
30,e6d69zl_1,"&gt; But I’ve talked with lawyers before for mock trial in high school,
OK, Perry Mason. I see we're dealing with an expert."

Finally someone recognizes and appreciates my unparalleled legal expertise."
32,e6d6hj8_2,"&gt;This ISN’T A COURT CASE
Inconsistent. Very unbecoming of someone making an argument."
33,e6d6hj8_3,"Either it’s okay to bring court-based concepts into arguments that aren’t about court cases (as ***you*** did before), or it’s not okay (as you criticized ***me*** for doing). You can pick one - not both - but you’re being inconsistent either way. That is, unless you admit that I’ve changed your view on something (“however minor,” pursuant to sidebar rules)."
34,dbrj3ub_1,"Most anti-feminists would become even more anti-feminist if they actually knew what is was.
&gt; most anti-feminists have either no, or a distorted, idea of what feminism actually is
I think most recognize that feminism is the promotion for women's rights/promotion for the consumerist interests of women."
35,dbrj3ub_2,"&gt; most anti-feminists have no idea of the realities of being a woman
That's true; men don't know what is like to work a dead end job for 30 years before waking up one morning and feeding your cat at which point you realize you utterly wasted your life. Men don't know what it is like to feel so emotionally broken that the only way you conjure life temporarily back to your permanently dead body is to be defiled by peoples who names escape you. Men don't know what it is like to have such a void in heart emotionally that the only thing of fucking meaning you can do in your life is go protest to let Muhammad into your country so maybe, just maybe, one of them is hot and rapes you in a back ally somewhere. Men don't know what it is like to be so confused by the culture that they think being objectified sexually is wrong, but getting gangbang Dp'd by 5 black dudes is ""liberating""."
36,dbrj3ub_3,"Most men have no idea how utterly pointless and and meaningless life is  for women since feminism took hold. Indeed they have they're facing problems of their own sexually, but at least they still live the life most accommodating to them overall.
&gt; most anti-feminists simply don’t understand women, period
Indeed, but then again who truly does? The evolutionary differences are remarkable and with with lots of research it still confuses me at times."
37,dbrj3ub_4,"&gt;  Rather, it is addresses the very real issues women still face on a daily basis.
Well, it's certainly about addressing issues women face, by making them worse."
38,dbrlkqg,"Dude, you sound depressed.  I think you might want to look into some professional help.  I really wish you peace and happiness.  "
39,dbrlwus_1,"This is exactly the type of condescending comment I'd expect from a subreddit like this. You can't argue at an intellectual level (not to be overly self aggrandizing) so you try to make personal attacks.
I'm not saying I'm not depressed, but what does that even have to do with anything? We live in a society that is complete and utter rot, evil is good and good is evil. It stands to reason that anyone who doesn't accept this would feel alienated. Even those that do accept it are extremely alienated, that is what the whole culture is setup to do: break people."

42,dbrmue8_1,"I mostly agree but I'm more like a Taoist who believes in eternal ideas that bring the most harmony so ""reactionary"" isn't a label I think suits me even if thats what the Marxists will call me.

47,d85vi9n_1,"I understand that this is your impression of feminists, but how on Earth are you able to know that ""most feminists"" feel this way?
&gt; Feminists want equal pay, but do not want equal representation when it comes to workplace fatalities and employment in ""dirty jobs"" such as sewage maintenance or waste management.
I'm confused. Women aren't allowed equal pay at desk jobs because they are disproportionately employed at other jobs? I, as a man, deserve more money at my desk job because other men serve shitty jobs that I choose not to? I am so confused."
48,d85vi9n_2,"&gt; Feminists are okay with the status quo of the extreme advantage they receive in practically all aspects of the legal system. Less prison time for the same crimes, advantages in custody disputes, extreme biases in child molestation cases, etc..
Where did you get this idea from? That feminists are ""ok"" with this?"
49,d85vi9n_3,"&gt; Most feminists forget that while women had to metaphorically fight for the right to vote in the past, a majority of men literally had to fight (through military service) for the right to vote. Women's suffrage was about earning the right to vote while avoiding the burdens that came along with that right.
So, because women did not have to physically fight for the right to vote, they are somehow dodging fighting responsibilities? How can you say this when feminists have worked so hard to allow women to join the military? It's men that have kept women out of the military."
50,d85vi9n_4,"&gt; Feminists are concerned with online sexual harassment, but don't seem as concerned with online death threats (primary directed towards men), and don't appear to consider that only men are 'swatted'.
Many online feminists receive death threats, this is hardly a symptom that is unfairly targeting men."
51,d85y4rt_1,"The ""idiot dad"" is funny precisely because it violates an implicit stereotype of men as intelligent. That's how humor works, it violates an expectation, and so humorous figures actually reveal the expectation by expressing the opposite. For every ""idiot dad"" in comedies, there are 100 ""intelligent dads"" with dutiful wives in serious works. Also funny is how, all the MRA's I see complaining about Homer Simpson or Peter Griffin, none of them seem to care much about their supporting-role, careerless housewives that are afforded one, maybe two episodes per season where they do anything of note, or the near complete absence of familiy TV shows where the wife is a more prominent character than the husband. This pattern would suggest, in fact, that your criticism of ""wanting equality without the disadvantages"" applies much more readily to MRA's."
52,d85y4rt_2,"&gt;Gender stereotypes are portrayed as a women's issue by only speaking of the negative ones associated to women.
[You'll find this poster is incredibly popular in, you guessed it, Feminist circles](https://www.syracuseculturalworkers.com/products/poster-every-girl-every-boy)"
53,d85z3im_1,"For the record, i don't consider myself a MRA
In the idiot dad context, yes you are correct. However there are other examples: The rape of men is considered to be humorous, while the rape of women is not (EG - the rape scene in Wedding Crashers, ""don't drop the soap"").
It's just an example of gender roles and/or stereotypes that both genders endure. MRAs are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to men, and feminists are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to women."
54,d85zj9e_2,"&gt;MRAs are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to men, and feminists are almost exclusively concerned with ones that are a burden to women.
Except it's false for feminists. Especially with feminists being major supporters of the LGBT movement, their examination of male stereotypes has deepened considerably over the years, and are the first to point out how men are punished when they step outside the roles defined by masculinity (particularly as gay men and trans women do). Again, the treatment of effeminate men, gay men, and trans people in general is something MRA's are oddly silent about."
55,d860jzy_4,"So, is my reasoning incorrect? Or, is my reasoning mostly correct but I'm wrong about this being uncommon in the feminist community? The majority of my views on feminism are from NOW.Org, so if there is a more official spokesgroup for feminism then I'd be interested in seeing that as well."
56,d864huv_1,"Your reasoning isn't incorrect, but you're holding specific groups to unreasonable standards. Putting aside the point that feminism isn't a homogeneous group of views and doesn't have any 'official' spokespeople, there are a few reasons why this is the case:
&gt;Thus, when I see a feminist discussing gender roles and how the impact women, I conclude that they are only concerned with women being in gender roles. It'd be one thing if the argument began with ""we're going to focus on gender roles that impact woman"" or something similar, but in my experience this isn't common.
Why can't this be implied? When you see a poster that says ""5k To Cure Colon Cancer"", do you expect it to say ""We recognize and appreciate that colon cancer is not the only cancer, and that prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia, pancreatic cancer, and a litany of non-cancerous illnesses are all horrible diseases in their own right. However, as an organization started by and for patients, families, and loved ones affected specifically by colon, we are specifically attempting to raise money for colon cancer."" If they don't, are they only concerned with improving the status of colon cancer patients and therefore selfishly disregarding the plight of lymphoma survivors?"
57,d864huv_2,"&gt;It doesn't make sense to me to discuss gender roles and only mention ones that impact a certain gender. I don't see how this helps change or resolve the problem. I don't even get why it's something feminists or MRAs would talk about if they were concerned about ending gender roles. If someone discusses gender roles, and only mentions a single gender, then I think it's reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end gender roles, but rather they want to change them to be more beneficial towards a specific gender.
Again, if someone discusses curing cancer and only mentions a single type of cancer, is it reasonable to conclude that they don't want to end cancer, but rather they want to change the landscape of medical research funding to be more beneficial towards a specific cancer?"
58,d86bqrm_2,I'm not sure the example cited really is in the scope of my view. In that situation it's a person donating to a cause that benefits the personal situation they happen to be in.
59,d86bzje_1,"&gt;It's not implied though, and this is fine. When people donate to these causes there is no expectation that the money is going towards curing all forms of cancer. Those and other groups are very clear on what their goal is, and don't misrepresent themselves.
You don't think it's clear enough that the National Organization for Women is an organization intended to address inequalities which affect women?"
60,d86cm12_1,"I think where we disagree is probably on our views of what equality means in this context. My view is that women already have social, political, and economic equality to men.
Firstly, there are no longer any laws in our country that are sexist.
Secondly, whether one is born female or male, that person will have arbitrary burdens and advantages placed upon them simply because of their gender. This happens to both genders, and thus both genders are equal. The inequity only occurs based upon the situation one finds themselves in."
61,d86cm12_3,"So to me, when a group is trying to eliminate one aspect of gender roles or double standards that happen to negatively impact just a single gender, they cannot be advocating for equality, rather they are advocating for advancement.
To just use objectification for example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""of women"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude the male gender from the argument against objectification."
62,d86dx8t_1,"&gt;I think where we disagree is probably on our views of what equality means in this context. My view is that women already have social, political, and economic equality to men.
This is demonstrably untrue in many ways. There's an enormous amount of evidence for things like pay disparity (even controlling for choice of work, hours, experience, etc), rates of sexual assault, reproductive rights, healthcare costs, and on and on. But even if it weren't:"
63,d86dx8t_2,"&gt;Firstly, there are no longer any laws in our country that are sexist.
So? Is violent crime no longer an issue because it's already illegal?"
64,d86dx8t_3,"&gt;Secondly, whether one is born female or male, that person will have arbitrary burdens and advantages placed upon them simply because of their gender. This happens to both genders, and thus both genders are equal. The inequity only occurs based upon the situation one finds themselves in.
This is a false equivalence. You can't just say that gender equality already exists because men and women both have problems. Gender equality isn't a state where both genders are equally subject to social bias, it's a state where neither gender is. The removal of any one destructive effect of gender roles/standards/biases is a step towards equality, it's not promoting inequality because it doesn't somehow annihilate a commensurate amount of bias towards the opposite sex. It's not a zero-sum proposition. Women being less screwed doesn't somehow reduce the stature of men in society."
65,d86dx8t_4,"&gt;If my dream is to be a cement worker, it's pretty great to be male. If my dream is to run a daycare center, it's going to suck to be male. If I happen to be getting sentenced for murder, I'd do just about anything to be female rather than male.
All of these things suck. They're all bad. If you eliminated any one of these biases it would create a more equal world regardless of whether or not any of the others were also solved."
66,d86dx8t_5,"&gt;To just use objectification for example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""of women"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude the male gender from the argument against objectification.
Why? Explain how that's different from: ""To use cancer as an example: If one is against that, then be against it. As soon as ""colon"" is added to the equation then it's an effort for advancement, not equality. The person is choosing to exclude all non-colon cancers from the effort to cure cancer."""
