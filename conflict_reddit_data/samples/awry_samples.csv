27,cuo3eb6,"I thought the advantage of creating a unisex bathroom is to conserve space... so having different kinds of fixtures, which in turn would require a bigger area, kind of beats the point?

So one bathroom for gents, and one for the ladies. that's expensive. Let's mash them together into a single room to cut costs. Makes sense.

And then you realize you can only fit so much on a single room.

So, do you place 2 toilets and 2 urinals, or 4 toilets which can be used by everyone?

150,cv2pmya,"Your stance comes from a position of ignorance of the topic you're taking a stance on. Losing weight is not simple, nor is it easy, especially for someone with exacerbating conditions such as thyroid problems, pernicious anemia, diabetes, heart disease, and eating disorders. Add to that, the more weight one has to lose, the more difficult it is to lose it and keep it off. In fact, permanent weight loss is fairly rare. The vast majority of people cannot lose weight and maintain that weight loss on their own when we're talking amounts of 100+ lbs. And it is not because they are lazy or unmotivated. It's a matter of biology. 80% of people who lose significant amounts of weight will gain it back, and often more than they lost. To presume it's laziness and lack of motivation is nothing more than a personal bigotry against obese people, and there is absolutely no truth to it. Are there some lazy obese people? Absolutely. But anyone who has lost that much weight hasn't done it by being lazy OR unmotivated. To think they have is just ignorant. 

To truly understand this, you need to learn from sources who aren't in the BUSINESS of weight loss. Those sources have a motivation to be dishonest and unrealistic. Learn from actual medical sources who aren't trying to profit off the obese. Actual scientists and doctors who are motivated by wanting people to be healthy. When someone who is severely obese loses weight, they have metabolic and hormonal changes that effectively sabotage them. No amount of motivation is going to make a difference in that biological reality. What's more, new research is showing that those changes aren't going away, even after a year or more. One of those hormones, Leptin, fell by 2/3 or more after weight loss. Leptin tells the brain how much body fat is present. When that hormone falls, the metabolism slows and appetite increases because the body thinks it needs to store *more fat*. In the studies, the leptin levels remained low a year after the weight loss, and only rose as the participants regained their weight. 

And that's just one way in which the body self-sabotages. 

Unless it is your body, it is not for you to judge if surgery is a viable option. Even so, if you want to have an opinion about it, the least you could do is shed some of your ignorance on the matter by educating yourself. Are you aware, for example, of everything a patient has to go through *before* they're even allowed to undergo such a surgery? They have to spend at least a year (usually closer to 18 months-2 years) trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, for one thing. These are NOT unmotivated people. Television and the media may portray weight loss surgery as a quick fix, but it's no picnic, it isn't easy at all. Your entire life changes when you have it. Your body reacts differently to everything. Your skin changes, your tastes change, there's emotional and mental tolls on the patient. It is NOT an easy, quick fix that just sheds the weight and makes life easy. 

People who undergo this surgery HAVE done the eating less/moving more route. It wasn't enough. It isn't always enough, no matter what the reddit circlejerk says.",sweetmercy,cv2pmya,1442347521,1,,2
151,cv2pmya,"Ahem, I'll just leave this scientific study here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8077323

Restricting calories works, whether other health problems are present or not. It is not ""weight loss business"", it is science. Eating less food isn't a very difficult thing to do. Everyone is capable of eating less. In fact, caloric restriction and proper dieting increases leptin sensitivity in obese patients. 

Here is another study for your pleasure: http://www.biochem.arizona.edu/classes/bioc462/462bh2008/462bhonorsprojects/462bhonors2006/warzeckas/caloric%20restriction%20reverses%20leptin%20receptor%20deficit.pdf

I am aware of what a patient goes through before their surgery and I can assure you it is not 1-2 years of closely monitored caloric restriction. It is the patient telling the doctor ""I've tried to lose weight but couldn't"". Improper measuring and calorie counting will sabotage weight loss but it is very possible for someone who measures and counts properly to lose weight.

Everyone can do it. It doesn't require surgery. It requires lifestyle change. http://community.myfitnesspal.com/en/discussion/10164678/wheelchair-user-130lbs-healthier",maotzu,cv2r6nq,1442349744,2,cv2pmya,2

376,cvj801d,"I would argue that context is indeed a factor, but that you must take into consideration how common is that context.

For example, being male is an advantage in most countries of the world. You have a much higher chance at professional employment and political office up to the highest offices that exist. Most world leaders are male, for example.

Being male is not an advantage in every situation though. For example during times of war and conflict, you are much more likely to be in military service and much more likely to be killed through violent action.

In order to determine if males are privileged, we must take into consideration the likelihood of all scenarios. This is because being privileged does not ensure a better life, it refers to the fact the better things are more likely to happen.

As an example, being rich does not ensure your happiness in any situation, but it does increase your chances at happiness. The benefit is there, though you may or may not enjoy it. Are there situations where being rich and being in the right context does not result in happiness? Of course there are, as rich does not equate to happiness, it only enhances the chances of happiness.

So, in that context, male privilege is true for employment in almost every country in the world. If you are born male, you have employment privilege even if you live in a country where employment favors women. This is simply because you have more options available *at all times* to change your employment opportunities for the better. Contrast that for women who may enjoy employment privilege in small pockets of the world, but have few options outside of those areas.",skacey,cvj801d,1443618470,6,,3

What you are saying when you call someone ""that is so [something it's not]"" is to either remove its identity (call a hetero gay, call a human a dog or pig, call a male a girly, call an adult a baby) or exagerate some trait for humour purposes.  

I think homophobia is an attitude and saying ""that's so gay"" is another, maybe you can find resonable overlap between them, but confusing them is probably more harmful that demanding more political correctness.

This *it's an insult because it misidentifies you* argument is often repeated, but doesn't really hold water. Your own examples are good examples of the opposite of the point you were trying to make.

&gt; call a hetero gay

That is an insult because gay people are seen as inferior or disgusting to many people.

&gt; call a human a dog or pig

This is an insult because it removes your status as a person and assigns you the lower status of an animal.

&gt;  call a male a girly

This is an insult because it is seen as shameful for a man to eschew his masculinity. This works as an insult if you believe femininity is weaker or inferior to masculinity.

&gt;  call an adult a baby

This is in an insult because babies are emotional, immature, and naive. It's lowering the person's social status.



If just misidentifying someone was insulting purely in and of itself, without the misidentifier being important at all, then insults would be much more varied. ""Stop acting like such an Astronaut!"" for example, my friend's not an astronaut, so by your argument about how insults work she ought to be quite offended by that misidentification/insult.

But of course that's not a real world insult, because insults of misidentity aren't inherently insulting. Rather, for it to be insulting, what you are misidentifying the person as must be lesser than what they are. Which means when you tell someone they are acting gay, or are gay.

&gt;U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch pledged that the Department of Justice will go after hate speech that might incite violence against the Muslim community, she told a crowd of Muslim-Americans and supporters Thursday night.

&gt;“Obviously this is a country that is based on free speech,” Lynch told the audience at the Muslim Advocates dinner in Arlington, VA. “But when that edges towards violence…we will take action.”

http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2013/03/05/in-free-speech-a-line-between-offputting-and-illegal/inciting-violence-is-not-protected-speech

&gt;Perhaps the most famous argument for limiting First Amendment rights was Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.’s 1919 opinion that even the most stringent free speech protection would not cover a man who deliberately and falsely shouted “fire” in a crowded theater. For Holmes and the unanimous Supreme Court, speech whose aim is to cause violence or damage could be restricted.

&gt;Subsequent decisions tightened the tests for what might be considered incitement to violence. Guidelines spelled out in 1969 added three factors: to be subject to restriction, speech must have the intent and the likelihood of causing imminent violence.",TrialsAndTribbles,cyxdtqd,1452734456,1,cyxdbxc,15
1736,cyx597p,"Nope. The test is that speech must be directed towards imminent lawless action. ""Kill this guy right here"" is not protected; ""Killing blacks is morally right"" is protected.

In fact, we don't have to speculate, because this was literally an exact case before the Supreme Court. KKK leaders were arrested for advocating violence against blacks and Jews. In Brandenburg v. Ohio, a *unanimous* Supreme Court ruled that advocacy of violence is constitutionally protected.

The reference to the Holmes opinion? That case is thoroughly discredited, holding as it did that the government could ban opposition to military conscription. The rule is *much* narrower. Advocating violence towards minority groups is unquestionably protected speech. ""Hate speech"" is not an actual thing that exists in US law.",cpast,cyxeq54,1452735986,1,cyxdtqd,15

1738,cyx597p,"Or weaker, since it makes it clear that ""hate speech"" is not valid grounds for the government to act. Your argument boils down to ""this is legal, so that means we should *definitely* keep out people who do it. Can't have people doing these legal things!""",cpast,cyxfbyv,1452737014,1,cyxf9l1,15

Given your seeming reluctance to classify anyone who doesn't explicitly support the entire US Constitution as someone who could legitimately be a citizen, and your insistence that the fact that something being protected speech means that you need to exclude anyone you can who might do it (because this thing that everyone in the US very definitely has the right to do is bad, and we need to prevent people doing it any way we possibly can), I think it's doubtful that you'd pass your own test.

I always see this sort of argument brought up and I frankly don't understand it. It's taking the system we currently have and shaking it up hoping that the end result will be identical to what we're already dealing with. It's this hope and promise that the free market will just magically sort this problem out so let's remove governmental protections for protected classes.

Pretty much your only issue with the way things are currently run is that you think ""it sets a bad precedent to enforce this"" and I'm not sure what exactly you mean there. Are you saying that the government is going to use this justification to...force you to hang out with gay people? I don't really see where this slippery slope can lead.

Owning and operating a business is not really a right, it's a privilege. You have to get a business license, you're forced to pay taxes, you're forced to abide by safety and zoning regulations. This is just one more regulation that we've put in place because of a long list of historical problems related to this very issue. Allowing discrimination against minorities only serves to treat those people like second class citizens.

The community uses its power in the government to regulate business, and this is just one of the ways in which it does just that.",BenIncognito,d27fgau,1460983075,37,,16
3485,d27fgau,"&gt; If the loss of business should be incentive enough, why is there such a big push to remove discrimination laws?

Because there are plenty of cases where discriminating results in a GAIN of business, and someone should be free to make those decisions for themselves.

A couple of examples:

Chariot:  The new ride service that is basically marketing itself as a female-only Uber.  Their motivation is clear.  They believe women will be more comfortable both working AND catching a ride with their service.  They're probably right.  In that case, discriminating along gender lines serves a clear purpose for their business model.

A second example:  A female-only gynecologists office.  I believe they're perfectly within their rights to refuse to hire a completely qualified male physician, if they believe that it will draw patients to their practice who are more comfortable being seen by a woman.  

Your claim that ""Owning and operating a business is not really a right, it's a privilege"" is only the case because we decided to MAKE it the case.  It's not really valid to say ""We'll shut you down if you don't have this license.  Oh, and by the way, now that you have to have a license, it's a privilege, and we can do anything we want with regard to your business.""",scottevil110,d27h6so,1460986606,-1,d27fgau,16
3486,d27fgau,"&gt; Because there are plenty of cases where discriminating results in a GAIN of business, and someone should be free to make those decisions for themselves.

Sure, that's sort of my point. The free market isn't going to magically solve this problem, and as you correctly point out in situations where discrimination would result in a boost of business.

That said, I'm not so sure that businesses have a right (or should have a right) to do whatever it takes to boost profits. I mean, driving that grease to the proper disposal plant is costly when there's a perfectly good lake right there. And it's just sooooo much time and effort (and therefore money) to clean all of these rats nests out of my kitchen, I kind of like the little guys and my customers barely notice the feces.",BenIncognito,d27hajw,1460986796,6,d27h6so,16
3487,d27fgau,"&gt; I mean, driving that grease to the proper disposal plant is costly when there's a perfectly good lake right there.

I don't think this is a valid comparison.  Pollution is actively harming others against their will.  It's outside the scope of voluntary transactions.  It's rightly against the law to pollute regardless of whether you're involved in a business or not, because it has directly negative consequences on unwilling parties.

This is very different than talking about simply who you choose to hire and serve.  You're under no obligation to be running a business (and therefore hiring and serving anyone) at all.  I don't believe choosing to start a business suddenly gives everyone the right to work for you.  

It's your livelihood and your investment on the line.  You should be left to make your own decisions regarding how to make that business succeed.   

The free market isn't going to solve it, because it isn't a problem.  Why is it a problem for anyone at all if Chariot refuses to hire men?  So what?  From my perspective, it'll be like Chariot never existed.  It's not like they took away my existing job.  They have their market, and they're going to serve it.

3489,d27fgau,"&gt; So you think it would be okay if in a small community black people are effectively barred from employment and being served at the majority of establishments? You don't think that would ""actively harm"" anyone against their will?

Whether I think it's okay and whether I think it should be legal are two very different questions.  No, I don't think it's okay, but I do think it should be legal.

Because no, that's not directly harming anyone.  It's refusing to serve something that they didn't have to serve to anyone in the first place.  Going back to my example of Chariot, if I'm a black man, and a sandwich shop opens up in my town that refuses to serve black people, then yeah, I'll be pissed, but I can't say I'm harmed.  To me, it's as though a new sandwich shop never opened in the first place.  

And that's a problem that the free market WILL solve if you're talking about some widespread issue, in a made up town that doesn't exist in this millennium.  

I'm pretty openly atheist, and I live in a very Christian area.  If places start refusing to serve known atheists, then yeah, I'll be pissed, but I'll respect their misguided decision.  And if enough of those places start popping up, then the market is pretty ripe for places to be more atheist-friendly, thus drawing my business.

For a more current example, take HB2, here in North Carolina.  Effectively made it legal for businesses to discriminate against LGBT people.  You know what the response has been?  A shit load of businesses proudly touting their LGBT-friendly policies, and they're booming because of it.  ",scottevil110,d27is7e,1460989308,-3,d27hrtg,16

It's ridiculous to ""respect"" a ""misguided decision"" just because of some weird adherence to libertarianism. Yes, it absolutely does hurt the black community if sandwich shops that don't serve them start popping up.

I'm going to end this conversation with this, I know it's really great to not belong to any outward minorities that would be discriminated against in this way. But this shit affects a bit more than just pissing people off.

Yes.  I do.  Because I think one is a right, and the other isn't.  You don't have a right to feelings.  I think it's abhorrent to treat someone that way, but freedom means the freedom to be a dick.  If we start taking it away when people use it in ways we don't like, then it's not really freedom anymore, is it?

That's like saying ""Wow, you value someone's right to free speech over someone else's right to not hear offensive things.""  Yes.  I very much do.  Because that's what makes it a right.  Being able to have it even when you're a dick about it and use it in a dickish way.  

Again, I live in the south.  Right in the middle of those made-up places where you seem to believe that the law is all that's keeping us from reinstating slavery.  I'm living right through the middle of exactly what happens when you allow discrimination.  You may have noticed in the news lately that it's presently 100% legal to hang a sign on the door that says ""No gays allowed"".  

You know what's happening?  Right here in the middle of the Bible Belt?  No one is hanging up those signs.  Quite the contrary.  Places are proudly advertising their friendliness toward the LGBT community, and they're kicking ass because of it.  Are there some hateful people who are boycotting those businesses?  Of course there are.  But they're doing just fine.

This is how I see this:

A sale is a two-way transaction.  Someone selling, and someone buying.  If you're the one buying, you have every right in the world to shop where you want for whatever reason you want.  If you choose not to shop in a black-owned store, no one can stop you from making that decision.  If a black man opens a store in a racist town, no one ever has to shop there.  

For some reason, though, we decide that when you're on the other side of the counter, you don't have those rights anymore.  Whereas you can freely choose from whom you BUY, apparently you can't choose to whom you sell.  That is inconsistent to me.  ",scottevil110,d27jlin,1460990566,-1,d27j9x1,16

Exactly my point.  I don't have to open a bar at all.  Let's go back to your completely unrealistic example of a town that won't serve black people.  I'm considering opening a restaurant.  But I don't want to serve black people, like many others in my racist asshole town.  Before I open that restaurant, there is no place for a black person to get a sandwich.  AFTER I open that restaurant, there is no place for a black person to get a sandwich.  Literally nothing has changed from the POV of a black person.  They couldn't get a sandwich before, and they can't now.  To them, there is no new restaurant.

There is no practical difference whether I open the shop to SOME, or don't open it at all.  The only thing left is feelings, and I don't believe we should be making laws to preserve someone's feelings.  

By stopping me from opening a restaurant with that policy, how have you helped the black people in my town?  They're still not getting a sandwich.  All you've accomplished is making sure that the white people don't get a sandwich either.

Our problem is with anti-bestiality laws that are extra laws that makes non-abusive sex illegal.

That's not a flaw, that's part of the party. Becoming the candidate for the party comes with a lot of benefits. You get full use of their money, resources, and connections.

I'm not sure this is a big issue. Jeb Bush has enormous amounts of funding and handily lost the primaries. Bernie was a good example of how candidates can still get tons of money from regular people. Hillary has spent nearly twice as much as Trump, but she doesn't have much to show for it. I'd like there to be transparency with opaque sources like super PACs, but I don't see a problem with the money existing.

What seperates the DNC in that case from being an organisation? A corporation if you will, that has a 50% chance to run the government? I would completely understand if there is an ecology of political parties, because in that case the american voter base can act as a selective force to put pressure towards parties that DO respond to the people's desires..

But with the DNC you're talking about an organisation that has roughly a 50% chance of getting into power, every election, almost guaranteed. See, my problem here is that where do the American people come into the democratic national party, if they're acting like a private organisation that 'samples' the public's view point but choses a candidate based on internal choices? What's the public's stake in this? 

Or more practically, what if I don't want Hillary, but would be fine with another candidate? It seems the majority of Americans think both candidates are very very poor. This seems to be a direct result of a two party system. Given that why is it even considered remotely allowable that those parties can internally choose who to prop up to represent them as President?

There *is* an ecology of political parties. The Libertarian party *also* has conventions and selects candidates. They *also* have their own rules. The fact that they aren't as successful as the top two just speaks to their ability to get support. You are always going to have powerful groups that people coalesce around. Republican and Democratic are generic enough to satisfy the majority of voters.

&gt; Or more practically, what if I don't want Hillary, but would be fine with another candidate? It seems the majority of Americans think both candidates are very very poor.

You have this dilemma because you have limited your participating in the process to just voting. If you want to influence the party, then you have to *participate in it*. That means volunteering, joining committees, attending meetings, canvassing, knocking on doors, or even running yourself. All of that stuff is done by the party. The majority of people in the party voted for Hillary. Picking someone *other* than Hillary means that the contributions of all those people who do the real work doesn't count.

&gt; This seems to be a direct result of a two party system.

This is a direct result of laziness and apathy. The candidates suck; what have *you* done about it? You want all these people who have organized and created a strong organization to support *your* idea of a candidate. Why? You have put nothing into this.

Are you saying the US is a political duo-poly that's one step away from behind a monopoly (or possibly already is one behind the scenes?).

&gt;There is an ecology of political parties. The Libertarian party also has conventions and selects candidates. They also have their own rules. The fact that they aren't as successful as the top two just speaks to their ability to get support. 

It could also be due to the fact that if many people don't think they are going to win, despite supporting them will not vote for them. This is a direct result of first past the post. Given a ranked voting system, Republicans who DON'T support Trump, but absolutely hate hillary could vote Gary Johnson first, followed by Trump then hillary. That way they can express their accurate political leaning (Gary Johnson), while also making sure that their voting for Gary Johnson isn't 'robbing' a vote from Trump if it comes down to Trump Vs. Hillary.

We have Trump because Republicans didn't have super delegates.

Given the sheer fervor of the Bernie supporters, and how many participated in that party for him, I think it's somewhat insulting (although I'm not insulted personally,  I'm sure someone is) to say ""This is a direct result of laziness and apathy.""... There were people that donated money they barely scrapped together to fight the '1%', there were non-stop threads on Reddit calling for telephone banking. I think with Bernie we saw perhaps the greatest involvement of every day people into the party ever; And he lost despite all this 'public involvement'.

It's arguable that he was only with the DNC because he understood that it's a two party system due to first past the post.

Trump is a polarising character but he does have immense public support. People see him as some sort of 'fighter' against the establishment/1%, and that's generally because Bernie was taken out. If the Republicans had super delegates we wouldn't have anyone in the race which the public could rally behind in opposition to 'the establishment'. I would say in the eyes of the public (forget the GOP) Trump is a massive success. 

Now if only this sort of thing happened with many other smaller parties that actually had a fair shot to get into government; we could see a rise of an actually decent person that is ALSO aligned with the public's views.

&gt;You shouldn't create laws just in case.

I think you absolutely should create laws just in case. You don't want to crash into every brick wall to know to swerve.

10092,df0cmtl,"I think the problem is that there tend to be two broad swaths of people with generally different interpretations of what ""racism"" means. One group defines racism as race-based hatred. You hear the word ""racist"" and picture men in white hoods burning a cross to intimidate a black family. We all agree that this is racist, and we (mostly) all agree that this is bad. Labeling someone a ""racist"" in these terms is quite clearly an insult. 

The problem you're describing comes in when racism is discussed in terms of the other broad swath of people, who define it as any form of conscious or unconscious prejudice based on race. For the second group of people *literally everyone is at least a little bit racist whether they intend to be or not*. Unconscious bias is a simple fact of life because of how the human brain operates. Under this paradigm of racism, calling out certain beliefs, attitudes, and actions as racist isn't (usually) intended to insult. It's intended to draw attention to something done unconsciously or thoughtlessly that one may not have realized has a racially-biased undertone to it. By drawing attention to it, the goal is to become more aware of our biases and work to overcome them, though clearly, they will never be eliminated. 

It's a bit like if someone is trying to helpfully point out that your zipper is down so you can fix it, but half the population thinks that having this pointed out to you means that the person is calling you a sexual predator. 

So I guess the question is, if you're in that first group where it isn't racism unless it's motivated by conscious hate, what do you suggest the second group call the form of racism that they're talking about? When the first group talks about these less-hateful, more-ignorant forms of racial bias, what term do they use? Or do they talk about it at all? ",john_gee,df0cmtl,1489679345,91,,13

I agree with the distinction you've made. The problem is that when people call out the latter type of ""racism,"" they don't say ""you have subtle, minute biases and preconceptions based on race."" They say *""you're racist.""*

In this nation, up until very recently, a racist was just about the very worst thing you could be called. It could instantly end your career in many professions (including legislature).

10156,df67ut5,"&gt; Freedom of religion is an inherent human right.

Why?

&gt; The main purpose of religion (in a very general sense) is for a person (and usually the community as well) to improve themselves morally and spiritually (however that may be defined – perhaps to reach salvation, to be enlightened, etc).

I recommend that you read the Bible.  This is not *at all* the purpose of Biblical religion, and since Biblical religions are the most followed in the world, this is actually relevant.  Religion in the Bible is a set of laws for a community.  God specifically chose the Israelites and told them to do and not do 613 things (that's the count according to traditional Rabbinical interpretation, anyway), and these laws were necessary in order to continue securing God's blessing.  If the community stopped following them, very bad things would happen.  Included in those laws were harsh punishments for people inciting the community to break the laws, as others have already mentioned, but generally anything that diminished the holiness of the community needed to be punished for the community to retain its holiness.  Of course, the Israelites and Judahites failed to follow the commandments, and they suffered the consequences in return: the Israelites were destroyed by the Assyrians, and the Judahites were exiled by the Babylonians, their temple destroyed.

The purpose of religion is to unite the community.  Personal morality and spirituality have little to do with it except in that they are required in order to properly observe the religion.  Maybe if you're moral and spiritual enough, God will help you fulfill his commandments, which are the main purpose of religion (well, some of the commandments do have to do with morality).

Now, I understand that modern Christianity might have been sidelined into a personal meaning thing, but it's an error to assume that the purpose of your liberal Christian denomination is the purpose of *religion*.

&gt; If a person finds that a religion different from their own (or the lack of one) will help them live a more moral, spiritual, or good-willed life, then why should they be stopped?

Because God said he'd punish us if we don't stop that person.  The Bible 100% practices collective punishment.

&gt; A Jew might simply choose to completely stop following Jewish traditions, or even conclude that atheism simply makes far more sense. No one's going to kill them over that, they have the right to choose what to do with their lives.

I did the latter, personally.  I didn't grow up following most Jewish traditions, but after I realized I didn't believe in God I started following more of them and going to synagogue.  Do you know why nobody will kill me over my non-belief?  I'll tell you: because nobody has the legal standing to do so.  Nearly 2000 years ago there was a court system, the Sanhedrin, that did have legal authority, but the Romans destroyed it along with the Second Temple back in 70 CE and now there is no court with the adequate authority.  Though back then, the punishment for leaving was banishment, not death.  You got the death penalty if you were trying to incite heresy (there was a story of one dude who may or may not have actually existed who was convicted for this crime, name was Yeshua, and there's now a whole religion thing based on him, it's weird).  Right now the Jews simply don't have the power to kick me out for non-belief or non-observance.

I have no comment on Islam specifically other than to note that, unlike Judaism, they *do* have legal authority in many countries to enforce the laws of their religion.  And I'll also note that Christianity used to be like that too, but Western society has thankfully moved past it and Christianity itself got fragmented, making it impractical even though the Vatican still exists.",xiipaoc,df67ut5,1490019954,1,,2
10157,df67ut5,"&gt; Why?

You don't want to have freedom of choice? 

&gt; The purpose of religion is to unite the community.

I'm not arguing about Judaism, I'm talking about religion in general.  Maybe Judaism doesn't fit in the way I defined religion. But still, it serves a purpose that should in theory make you and the community do good or not do evil. Ten Commandments and all that. 

&gt;  but it's an error to assume that the purpose of your liberal Christian denomination is the purpose of religion.

I didn't argue that, but I still hold that that is the usual goal of religions. Follow its rules for a greater cause or reason or benefit. Also for the sake of it, I'm an agnostic, but nominally I'm still a Catholic. At least in my country, I'm not sure the Catholic Church is something you would call liberal.

&gt; nobody has the legal standing to do so.

While this is not *false*, it is misleading. I can characterize any dichotomy as a 'free choice'. If I put a gun to your head and say ""Give me your money!"", you can *choose* to give me your money, or deal with whatever my next action might bring. On the other end of the spectrum are choices like, ""Do I want vanilla or chocolate?"". Every choice in between those two have various pressures and biases applied, whether from our peer group, our experience, or our society. 

It's clearly not the case that ""women want to have kids and men don't."" Yet the opportunity cost of childbearing and childrearing fall almost entirely on women. Women don't ""choose"" more 'flexible' jobs; they *settle* for them because the condition of childrearing places them at a disadvantage in the job market. They lose important productive years to childrearing because neither men (in the USA) nor society (in the USA) step up to help.

1)  Just because Trump praised the investigation during the campaign doesn't mean that his opinion didn't change when he got in office.  It is _very_ common for a POTUS to change their stance once they gain access to all of the information the POTUS has access to. Remember Obama said he would close Gitmo on Day 1 of his presidency, only to leave it open for the entire 8 year term; he learned things in office he didn't know in the campaign and it changed his decision.  It is possible that the same thing happened to Trump and his opinion changed on how the investigation was handled.

2)  Trump has only been in office for a little over 100 days.  You don't fire a high ranking government official until you have his replacement lined up.  Given all of the items on Trump's agenda, it is possible that this one was just lower priority and he is just now getting to it.

Because of the previously mentioned stereotypes. Men are seen as better workers, even if they are not. As a result, they will get payed more because they are ""better"" even if they are not.

It's still cost efficient from a companies view point, because they're paying more for the ""better"" worker, as even if that statement isn't true, they think it is.

I mean, bias towards men does exist. It's part of the reason orchestras (which are **purely** about talent) switched to blind auditions. It's said that it increased the chance a woman would proceed to the finals by 50%.

And it's not something you can really avoid without, ironically, implementing a sexist policy. When people are rated by their direct reports, all the way up a chain, there's no obvious fix for a gender bias.

It works in some jobs, but it is not a simple task in most workplaces.

I don't know. I don't even know exactly what an software engineer does. Are you saying it's impossible to measure your productivity and compare it to someone elses? 

Just out of curiosity, how does the discussion go when you go into wage negotiations? You just say you feel you have been very productive and hope your emoployer feels the same way?


&gt; It works in some jobs, but it is not a simple task in most workplaces.


Yet it has happened in no fields that i'm aware of. Doesn't that suggest something?

&gt; And then what about women in something like sales? Women might make less sales because they're women, and as a result get paid less. That's a ""real"" reason to pay less, but obviously it's a gender stereotype loop.

12523,dkgarco,"&gt; Well orchestras are hardly the same thing as billion dollar companies literally doing everything they can to improve their competitiveness.

Top tier orchestras are unreasonably competitive and always strive to be the ""best"". It's probably on par with a company's drive to save money. 

It was mostly just an example though of how women may appear worse. And that means being worse at pay negotiation, and not appearing as anything that statistics could ever pick up on.

&gt; Are you saying it's impossible to measure your productivity and compare it to someone elses?

I write code to solve problems. Sometimes I create new code, other times I bug fix old code. Objectively it's almost impossible to compare me to another person doing similarly. It is entirely subjective, which my manager thinking I'm doing a good job or a bad job. Hell, people who are able to sell their work better will rise quicker than those who do a better job but can't convince their manager they're good.

&gt; Yet it has happened in no fields that i'm aware of. Doesn't that suggest something?

Different fields have massively different pay gaps. I'd need to go researching, but it may well be the case that there is a small pay gap in sectors in which more objective stats can be determined.

I'm not going to claim that as true though, as it's just a hypothesis right now.

&gt; Just out of curiosity, how does the discussion go when you go into wage negotiations?

I assume you mean for a raise given the context. Everything I go into it with though is entirely subjective. I have achieved X, I believe I am working above average, timing it with some completed project which makes you look better. use that all as an argument.

It's hard to actually show my contribution being better than someone else's at least when we're close. Maybe I'm better at completing projects but worse and discovering new ideas, or maybe it's the opposite and I'm good at getting a project rolling but slow down at the end. Which is better? Is one even worse? 

That's where the bias jumps in. That nagging feeling that the woman is just trying to convince you when they weren't actually as amazing as they say might not exist when a man asks.

Anyway, this is likely the biggest issue with the pay gap. Men are either better at pay negotiation or do it more often. The former may have sexist biases (which again propagate in a way that doesn't encourage more female hiring), but the latter is fair and means no sexism. 

&gt; If the woman makes less sales she's being less productive, so I don't really see the point.

Then the concept of the pay gap still exists as an example for gender bias if the lower productivity it outside of her control. It may no longer be the companies fault, but it is still an example of sexism in society. Except in this case the solution would be positive discrimination which I'm particularly against.

--------

On this note I should say that I think the pay gap is minor, and is actually now self-fixing. Once pay is almost equal (as it is now) then you help remove biases over time and that will then equalise pay further. It's just a matter of time.",Pluckerpluck,dkh6go7,1500562793,4,dkh3ta8,11

Yes I don't question that. But they are not ""rational"" in the same way as companies driven by market processes. Music is far more, I dont know the best word to use, ""subjective"".


&gt; I write code to solve problems. Sometimes I create new code, other times I bug fix old code. Objectively it's almost impossible to compare me to another person doing similarly.


Well, I dont really know enough about the software engineering business to comment. But if the company sell the things you code customer satisfaction could be a way to measure productivity.

I mean, certainly it can't be fully subjective who's doing a better job. If I started working at your company it would be painfully obvious for everyone that you're a better software engineer than I am. So the question is really only on what basis we make that determination and then apply it to everyone.


&gt; Different fields have massively different pay gaps.


Are you sure about that? As far as I know the wage gap goes towards zero in pretty much all fields when you control for relevant factors. Which is partly the reason no serious economists take it seriously. (Another reason being what we're discussing now)


&gt; Men are either better at pay negotiation or do it more often. The former may have sexist biases (which again propagate in a way that doesn't encourage more female hiring)


Or both. But I don't see why you would say being better at wage negotitation may have sexist biases. It's possible I guess, but i've never seen any evidence for that.

I mean, it's pretty well established that men have evolved to be more aggressive and competetive which to me seems like qualities that would be useful in a negotiation, and also possibly explain why men negotatiate more often (which i've seen some studies suggest they do).

Not fully subjective no. But a non-negligible amount is subjective. Definitely enough that opinions sway pay.

Smaller, but KPMG determined that [38% of the pay gap](https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/1092526a22db269deec05c0d309c688861792185/0_0_908_1103/master/908.jpg?w=1065&amp;q=55&amp;auto=format&amp;usm=12&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0d6023a5fc1f7057533c0add212661e5) was created from discrimination.

Then there are arguments that it's not that women choose to work lower paying jobs, [but that jobs that get a high intake of women end up paying less over time.](https://academic.oup.com/sf/article-abstract/88/2/865/2235342/Occupational-Feminization-and-Pay-Assessing-Causal).

Basically, it's not necessarily as clear cut as one may initially thing.

&gt; But I don't see why you would say being better at wage negotitation may have sexist biases. It's possible I guess, but i've never seen any evidence for that.

This is why I bring up the orchestra. Pay negotiation is almost always simply trying to convince someone you deserve more. It's rarely completely objective and you're trying to subjectively convince someone you deserve more.

Orchestra is not as subjective as you claim. It's fairly obvious when someone is a better player than someone else, yet even still simply knowing the player was a woman massive lowered their chances of being accepted.

It is highly likely this applies to interviews and pay negotiation or anything else people facing as well. I see no reason why it would not apply.

&gt; I mean, it's pretty well established that **men have evolved to be more aggressive** and competetive which to me seems like qualities that would be useful in a negotiation, and also possibly explain why men negotatiate more often

Which, interestingly, is not necessarily the best sales tactic. Creating a rapport with the person goes a long way, and women tend to be better at that. However, the argument that it's why men negotiate more often could well be true.

Then you have to ask yourself though, should someone be paid more simply because they're asking for more money more often? Or should people be paid based on their skill?

Having pay be public would likely go a long way to reducing the effectiveness of pay negotiation, which is a good thing for most people, but a bad thing for those who are particularly good at it.

&gt; But it's not a pay gap if she's less productive.

It is a pay gap. That have the same job title and job role, but because of sexism (whether inside the company or out) she is doing worse. Now I agree with you that the company should be made to rectify that (that's positive discrimination), but it is included in what people call the pay gap.

In this hypothetical example, women with the same job and title will on average be paid less than men.",Pluckerpluck,dkhc584,1500568981,5,dkhba82,11

Well I mean, that's one study. And it doesn't even seem to control for hours worked nor education?

[This study says the gender pay gap is about 1.6%, so If we assume both studies are true that would mean that discrimination causes a wage difference of 0.6% (0.06**0.38)](http://mobile.abc.net.au/news/2017-06-30/bilnd-recruitment-trial-to-improve-gender-equality-failing-study/8664888?pfmredir=sm)


But let's just assume you're right, there is a pay gap and it's due to discrimination... so why are companies hiring men? Are they not aware of the pay gap that has been in the news for decades? Are they too dumb to take advantage of it?

That's really the only question I care about here. Why have none of these companies who are spending hundereds of millions on consultants to help them improve their profitability just decided to only hire women? They hire statisticans to analyse all the data they collect (big data), but none of them have figured out that they can pay equally productive women less, and make a bunch of money by doing so?


&gt; It is a pay gap. That have the same job title and job role


No it's not. How is it a pay gap if she is less productive?

There is no being in existence that lives for free, apart from some humans who have benefited enough from this ""capitalist economy"" to support their children in such a way and some dictators, but even they need to work somewhat for their survival.

No living being on earth can sit down and do nothing at all and survive. We need food, we need shelter, we need people.

&gt;Your boss steals the value of your labour in the form of profit and returns to you nothing

Except for a wage that you agree to beforehand and have the ability to negotiate to get a larger share of the profits you provide to them.

Tell me, if you created a company(perhaps its better to say factory for the marxists out there) and somebody came up to you and offered to work at your factory but they kept all the profits from their labor.

Are they not now exploiting you? You built this place, you laid the foundation. This is your house, why should they benefit from your work and you get nothing in return?

To offer another example a local hairdresser rents out booths(""chairs"") to other hairdressers. Should she give them away to avoid ""exploiting"" the people who willingly pay her? Should she just let them set up shop in her house without compensating her? Is she not now the one being exploited?

&gt;Should mindless spending and no budgeting result in no negative things happening to you? Should we get everything we want without effort? Should society enable such behaviors?

We should have all our basic needs met. She shouldn't starve because she made a bad decision. Our society is not some primal wasteland, we have to expect more of ourselves than the law of the jungle. If she can't pay her debts then she won't get more credit and won't be able to overextend herself further. She may not qualify for a home loan or a future car loan or a credit card. But she should never want for a safe place to sleep, food to eat, or essential medicine. 

&gt;Existence is exploitative. That is what existence means for a being living on planet earth.

It need not be. We can be better.

&gt;There is no being in existence that lives for free, apart from some humans who have benefited enough from this ""capitalist economy"" to support their children in such a way and some dictators, but even they need to work somewhat for their survival.

We are nearing a time where no humans will need to work. Automation will replace all human labour. But until we get there we live in a time where no one should perform a job that doesn't fulfill them. There is no need for this. Beyond that we should not live in a society driven by profit motive. If the workers, rather than a lazy capitalist at the top, owned their work places it would be immeasurably less exploitative. 

&gt;No living being on earth can sit down and do nothing at all and survive. We need food, we need shelter, we need people.

Soon we will. Until then we should transition to a more socialist economic model to reduce exploitation and improve quality of life.

&gt;Is the hospital ""exploiting"" me when I go there for life saving surgery? They are technically torturing me, even if it means my survival and requires my permission. Could you explain the fundamental difference between this example and your capitalism example?

In America yes the hospital is exploiting you by charging you unnecessarily massive fees and deriving profit from your essential medical treatment. No profit should ever be extracted from anything, but most especially essential services. If you were treated in a non-profit hospital in a country where the cost is subsidized by society at large there would be no exploitation there. You can argue 'they are technically torturing you' but you provided informed consent so it is not unethical, in this society where the cost is subsidized and the hospital is non-profit. In America you do not have this luxury. 

&gt;Except for a wage that you agree to beforehand and have the ability to negotiate to get a larger share of the profits you provide to them.

In employer-prospective employee negotiations the employer holds all the power. You will die without a job, there is a small number of possible employers, and you are not negotiating one-on-one. You are negotiating against every other prospective candidate. This is why collective bargaining is essential, the workers sit together rather than against one another.

&gt;Are they not now exploiting you? 

No. They are asking for a fair wage, that is to say they are asking to be paid the value they produce. The mindset that profit is acceptable makes this hard to understand, I'll admit. 


&gt;why should they benefit from your work and you get nothing in return?

They are performing the work. You are not. They are producing the value. You are operating a building that allows them to do so. It is reasonable for your costs to be covered from the value of the labour, that isn't profit. It's reasonable for a wage equal to that of your median labourer to be paid to you, that isn't profit. But when value is taken from the worker and given to the owner that is exploitation. An owner is not more valueable than a worker. Most of the time they're worth far less to the company, they don't add any value. 

&gt;Is she not now the one being exploited?

First, again, having her cost covered and paying a modest living wage is acceptable. But often the owner will extract nearly 50% from the stylists, clearly that is exploitation. No one deserves to accumulate wealth off of the labour of another. 

However, and mind you, if she owns the salon she is under no obligation to bring in other workers. If she wanted to she could do the work herself in which case she would be entitled to keep the entirety of the product of her own labour. No one forces her to hire stylists, she will not starve if she doesn't hire stylists, the relationship is not the same. Business owners hold all the power in these scenarios. 

&gt;Capitalism works because it is the most fair system we have created in a fundamentally unfair universe. Much like democracy.

Capitalism is less fair than social democracy, less fair than socialism, less fair than communism. It is not the most fair. Capitalism is the system that we have in place for the same reason the feudalism was in place before it. It's the system chosen by the people who already had the power, and it has reinforced their power well enough that we haven't been able to change it yet. Capitalism is inherently inefficient. The profit motive is inherently exploitative. Explain to me how it is more fair that one man sits in a 20 million$ penthouse selling his drug for $500 a dose when it costs him 1.66 to manufacture. Explain to me how it is more fair that millions go into poverty before dying, or billions already in poverty are denied essential life saving medicine so that one man can be a billionaire. Explain to me how that is more fair than having all of those people be healthy, have the medicine they need, have the food they need, and have a modest home that suits all their needs. 

&gt;And it works because just like my employer uses me, I use them. Everybody benefits from the arrangement, I couldn't provide the worth I do for them on my own and they couldn't provide the worth I do without me. Everybody wins.

I don't benefit from my employer stealing profit from my labour. I don't have the option to choose an employer that doesn't steal profit from my labour, other than death. The relationship is inherently coercive and it does me no good. 

&gt;The universe is fundamentally unfair. children are born every day with less than a year to live, people get horrible painful diseases, people get hurt every day by others and nature. To paint the negatives of existence itself as a property of capitalism is pathetic, and you people need to stop doing it.

And every day millions of people work to fix all of those conditions such that suffering can be minimized. They don't just accept it and say there's nothing that can be done. Capitalism causes unique suffering that the alternatives to it do not. We should work to eliminate that unique suffering to create a better world.

That's clear cut evidence right there and there are more videos like that. Moreover you see it in sitcoms ALL THE TIME and there is ALWAYS a laugh track over it when a man gets hit by a woman. Not to mention the studies showing that women initiate domestic violence against men at the same rate or even higher. It's disgusting how people run to the woman's aid immediately and will threaten to beat the man up or call the police. But if it's a man getting beaten up people openly LAUGH and stare or they say things like ""I wonder what he did to DESERVE IT"" 

equal rights equal lefts. Men are taller faster and at MINIMUM 2x stronger than women. If a woman decides to attack a 6'5 250lb guy then she deserves to get punched the fuck out. The weak argument you're going to reply with is ""well the woman can't do as much damage"" is for one bullshit and for 2 irrelevant. If a 5'4 100lb guy attacks a 6' 200lb you NEVER see people go ""well he shouldn't have hit the smaller guy because the smaller guy can't do as much damage"" no what you hear is ""he got knocked the fuck out like he deserved"" same should go for women.

&gt;One pretty easy way to refute your point is that MRA social movement people almost certainly consider this kind of thing unacceptable.

3rd wave feminism is garbage. They also think that ""man spreading"" and ""man splaining"" is a gender issue and even ADVOCATE assaulting men with something called ""man slamming"" which is where women intentionally slam into men while walking to get them to move.

And no it's not beside the point. Feminists can't even AGREE on what feminism is. Feminists never stand up for men that are assaulted. And some weak ""oh traditional gender roles r bad"" is not the same as ACTIVELY condemning the act.

It's like the old joke about the physicist who figures out how to predict who will win a horse race, you just have to assume a perfectly spherical horse.  

Genes are one of many factors which impact who we become as adults.  Environmental factors, which you simply write out as assumed to be perfect, also have a huge impact.  But you can't assume perfect environment when choosing a mate.

Given a choice between a partner with great genes and a tendency to psychologically abuse those in her care, and a partner with ok genes and a tendency to love and care for those under her protection, who is likely to help raise the more successful child?  Depends on your metrics for success, but I'd argue that if happiness is a part of the calculation then choosing someone likely to be a good parent is a much bigger factor than genetics.

Or given the choice between a partner with great genetics and no money or a partner with ok genetics and tons of money, might not a child not raised in crippling poverty be expected to have worse outcomes than one raised in wealth, even if the wealthy child is only genetically average? 

A child with great genes for intelligence, raised in a house with lead paint and a crappy school system is going to end up about as smart as a child with good genes for intelligence, raised without exposure to lead poisoning and in a good school system.

The kid with better genes can, a generation later, find their way into a better situation. And the principle still sticks, that their genes will be stronger, related to survival, and make their nation stronger.

That very thing happened with the Dutch. A while back, they were on of the shortest nations, because environment ruined their genetic potential. But once they got it right, their average height sky-rocketed.

I think you are underestimate just how much different God is from us. Somehow God is all powerful, all knowing, loving, just, and gracious. He is long suffering, yet still gets angry. He is never changing but can be persuaded. He has no beginning and no end.

-----

Poverty and obesity really have a lot in common epidemiologically.  It's an undeniable fact that if poor people simply spent less than they earned they would stop being poor - and if fat people consumed less than they expended they would stop being fat.

Both of these observations are true, relevant, important, and useless as advice for those who need it most.  Yeah, your middle-manager with three car notes could probably learn a lesson or two about basic home economics, but your three-job working minimum-wage worker doesn't need your damn advice about budgeting.  They know better than you do - but it's just not that easy.

It is an objective fact that people who do not take bullets into their bodies suffer no gunshot wounds.  The trick is finding functional strategies to actually carry out this stupidly simple advice.  How do I avoid bullets without hunkering down in my house under three mattresses until I die of thirst?  I have to move to somewhere with a lower crime rate.  To do that I need to secure better employment.  To do that I need to change by outward demeanor to one that does not make potential employers confuse me for the kind of criminal that I'm trying to get away from.  To do that I have to learn a whole new was of speaking and dressing, and I probably can't do anything about the color of my skin.  Hopefully I already have the qualifications to get such a job.  If not I'll need to do the opposite of the original advice and expose myself to additional danger while continuing to live in a terrible place in order to focus on getting the education I need to not have to do those things.

And on and on and on.

The story with poverty is nearly identical.  I'll not bother giving examples.

With obesity, it's often a question of reducing food intake without suffering suicidal ideation, psychotic episodes, severe bouts of depression, panic attacks.  Any one of those things can trigger a survival-level response to engage in comfort eating as a coping mechanism.  Being fat is bad for you, but your body knows that it's better to be fat than to take a bottle of pills and will override your responsible behavior when it comes to that.  This wouldn't be such a problem if people didn't use food to self-medicate for their psychological disorders.  Maybe if they had access to readily-available mental healthcare they would have better odds at navigating that tightrope.  Of course, it's made worse by the fact that being fat as a result of using food to manage a mental disorder or chronic abuse leads to being further abused, providing additional reasons to engage in more of the same behavior.  Those are extreme cases, yes, but there are plenty of cases like that and you would never know because their mental disorders are being managed *by food*.  It's no different from people managing their issues by taking ten shots of alcohol before bed each night, except that you don't criticise those people because you don't find out what they're doing until they die from it.

Did you know that putting big grotesque pictures of diseased body parts on cigarette packs makes people smoke *more*, not less?  See, cigarettes help people manage their stress, and looking at a black lung after finishing a cigarette is stressful.  A cigarette would sure help with that stress.

Now, I know what people think here.  ""Fuck off, get over it, put down the sandwich.  Nobody is force-feeding you"" and it's true.  Any individual could, in theory, muster up herculean willpower and go against every influencing factor and just start living healthy (and saving money, and with some extrinsic luck, maybe also land a dream job).  It's 100% true.  I can, you can, mostly anyone could.  When is the last time mankind solved a problem by having the entire population up and change their minds one day and go exactly against everything they've been doing for the last 40 years and just start being rational for once?

17197,dtgndyr,"It's nothing new. Foreign governments have attempted to influence US elections since the founding of the country. From the French in their war with Great Britain to the British and events leading to WWII, to [Ted Kennedy seeking help from Russia to challenge Reagan](https://www.forbes.com/2009/08/27/ted-kennedy-soviet-union-ronald-reagan-opinions-columnists-peter-robinson.html#654c82e7359a) to the [Clintons accepting illegal contributions from China in the 1996 campaign](http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/05/23/clinton.china/).

The biggest difference now is that the popular media is using foreign influence as the excuse for the Trump win, focusing their coverage on it as a way to undermine the election results and possibly make an unpopular (with them) president's victory invalid. I see this in much the same way as I saw republican attempts to question Obama's legitimacy by claiming he wasn't a natural born citizen. 

So, it isn't so much that American's are waking up to how the world works as much as it is some influencers are using ""Russian Collusion"" as an attempt to legally undermine the election results they didn't like. ",carter1984,dtgndyr,1517318147,-5,,6
17198,dtgndyr,"Just to be clear: you're saying there's no actual evidence of collusion? It's all a plot to undermine the president?

And on the Obama vs. Trump situation, you do know that even if Obama weren't a US citizen (he is), his not being born here would have no tangible impact on his ability to run the country, right? If the allegations against Trump were true, however, it would show he was compromised or otherwise beholden to a hostile foreign actor. The difference between these two controversies is a difference of degree, magnitude, and most importantly--relevancy.

The relentless birther attacks on Obama (pushed for years by Trump himself, by the way) were purely nationalist resentment against the color of his skin and perceived other-ness. In what other ways could they be interpreted?

But if it were *possible* that Trump knowingly and repeatedly sought aid from hostile foreign entities to win elections, punish his enemies, and up-end a system of government... Isn't that worth investigating? That's a little more impactful than what a sheet of paper in Hawaii says about one man's birth place, isn't it?

17199,dtgndyr,"&gt;resentment against the color of his skin and perceived other-ness. In what other ways could they be interpreted?

Well, that's actually a pretty easy one to answer - it was the right-wing having sour grapes over Obama winning the Presidency. I don't believe they were trying to form a conspiracy to get *the black man* out of the Oval Office; they were just grabbing at anything they could to try and invalidate a Democrat President(similar to now w/ Trump) and the thing they flailed at which stuck the most was the birther nonsense. 

I'm not saying it was rational or even credible - *of course it's not credible* - but I am saying that there's a VERY reasonable explanation for why the birther movement took hold that isn't about President Obama's race.

**EDIT** - another thought, you said this in your post:

&gt;But if it were possible that Trump knowingly and repeatedly sought aid from hostile foreign entities to win elections, punish his enemies, and up-end a system of government... Isn't that worth investigating? That's a little more impactful than what a sheet of paper in Hawaii says about one man's birth place, isn't it?

But to the right wing, the opposite is perfectly true, too:

&gt;But if it were possible that **Obama** ~~Trump~~ knowingly and repeatedly **forged an American identity** ~~sought aid from hostile foreign entities~~ to win elections, **disguise his father's country of origin** ~~punish his enemies~~ , and up-end **the political process** ~~a system of government~~... Isn't that worth investigating? That's a little more impactful than **a silly conspiracy about ""Russian hackers stealing the vote like this is CSI:Miami""** ~~what a sheet of paper in Hawaii says about one man's birth place~~, isn't it?

Depending on your political affiliation, you may lean one way or another on that. Depending on what lens through which you approach politics, you will likely be outraged by one of those two and say ""BUT THAT'S RIDICULOUS!"" and look at the other thinking ""this makes so much more sense.""

Everyone has already agreed that fully automatic weapons should be banned, and that ban is in place. Additionally, the government places restrictions on chemicals needed to develop homemade bombs from fertilizer. While nukes may be pretty difficult to develop for a regular person, plenty of war weaponry is already off limits to civilians. I would not like the country to rely on logistical barriers for these cases.

To your CMV, though,

&gt; the primary premise of the 2nd Amendment is that the citizenry has the ability to independently assert their other rights in the face of an oppressive government.

If the basic argument is that the Founders intended the second amendment as a bulwark against tyranny, they meant in fact that the Federal Government could not disarm state militias in favor of a standing Federal army.

We now have a standing Federal army without issue.

If an armed populace resulted in a less tyrannical government in 2018, you would see strong democracies filling out the list of countries with the most guns; you don't.

USA - 112.6 guns per 100 residents.
Serbia - 75.6.
Yemen - 54.8.
Switzerland - 45.7.
Cyprus - 36.4.
Saudi Arabia - 35.
Iraq - 34.2.
Uruguay - 31.8.

&gt; It is about citizens being allowed to own weapons capable of deterring governmental overstep.

I want to set aside race for a second to get a simpler example. If someone was raped by a man wearing glasses, I think you could expect two things:
One, she would have a visceral, fearful reaction when seeing a man with glasses. 
Two, she would intellectually understand that men wearing glasses are no more likely to assault her than men without glasses.     
     
Their initial gut reaction in any case is valid. If you see someone who looks like your attacker, it is natural to become fearful. How you process that response should be different though. Since it is clear that men with glasses are no more likely to rape someone than men without glasses, hopefully you can get to a point where they are comfortable around men with glasses again. 

As far as avoiding men after a sexual assault, I would say that it is slightly unfair to men who would never assault someone, but it is much more understandable. If I saw someone walking down the street with a gun and they shot me, I will probably avoid people carrying guns in the street. It might be unfair to law-abiding gun owners, but the fact that someone has a gun in public is related to my injury. Similarly, the sex of strangers around a woman is related to the type of crime (sexual assault) whereas race is not.

The purpose of the Gulf War was to defend the right of Kuwait to be a sovereign state, which was successful.

&gt;and global terrorism has increased dramatically since then

The only place terrorism has increased is the Middle East.

In Europe, terrorism peaked in the 70's (Baader-Meinhof, Red Brigades, IRA, ETA). In Sri Lanka, terrorism peaked in the 90's (Tamil Tigers). In Cambodia, terrorism peaked in the 70's (Khmer Rouge). In Chechnya, terrorism peaked in the 90's.

&gt;Bin Laden was trying to attack the USA, was not because he ""hated freedom"". Rather, he was tired of the USA constantly meddling in the affairs of Middle Eastern countries, and wanted the American military presence in his native Saudi Arabia gone. 

I think you have a rather naive picture of Bin Laden's motivation. Here is a direct quote on what he actually wanted from America:

*""We call you to be a people of manners, principles, honour, and purity; to reject the immoral acts of fornication, homosexuality, intoxicants, gambling's, and trading with interest.""*

And here is his summary of the war:

22898,e3h7l5r,"&gt; By legalizing prostitution in regulated brothels, the typical objections to the legalization of prostitution (human trafficking, STD's, etc.) are taken care of.

No, they aren't. It's even easier to hide a trafficked victim in plain sight if you know where she is 24/7. A trafficker has it easier having them all in a legalised brothel mixed in with the non-trafficked prostitutes and making them lie and say they are there willingly. 

Rescuing a human traffic victim takes time. You can't simply send a social worker to ask all women inside if they are there against their will, and then having her walk away with them at the end of the visit. Assuming you do just that and none of them lie, the social worker is going to simply collect the information and take it to relevant authorities. By the time they bash in to rescue these poor women, they aren't going to be there anymore; and a significant part of them are going to be found in a lake/river years after, if they are found at all.

Yes, pornography and strip clubs should be also illegal for the exact same reasons: Trafficked victims are traumatized beyond help and scared for their lives, knowing one wrong step is going to get them killed, or at least abused even further. You never know if the woman on your computer screen is doing that porn movie willingly or ig she was coerced into it. I have been told most of those moans/screams they make are actually signs of real pain. This is because porn is not meant to be comfortable for either actor; it just have to look good on camera.

And in strip clubs' case, I bet not even you would argument that these women's smiles are genuine. That sturdy pole they usually dance around isn't gentle on their skin. This is why [circus acrobatsalways put some clothes between their skin and whatever will be in contact with it otherwise](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phB5VDvGiu0): As you see, the woman in the video is working with a long rag hanging from the ceiling and not an iron pole, and she's still wearing something to help reduce friction and avoid damaging her skin. Strippers don't have this luxury.

Boxing is a bit different. For one, it involves a lot of protective gear and it doesn't involve sex at all. The fighters are at exactly 0 risk of being harassed or followed home by an insane fan, for obvious reasons: If you do, they are going to beat you into the curb. A strip worker doesn't have this luxury either: Her job is to have a nice, slender body and be there to dance and bee seen (and maybe sometimes touched if she gets too close to the audience). She's not there to be tough and know how to dodge punches. Any man in the audience is bigger, stronger and heavier than she is, while the opposite is true in a boxing match, where few men in the audience will be more capable than either boxer.

Smoking is entirely different: It harms you, of course, but no one kidnapped you to force you to start the vice. Peer pressure doesn't equal abuse. Specially when we are talking about sexual abuse as the main topic. Show me one smoker who has been raped to force them to start smoking and I'll apologise.

And the same is true for alcohol, and to an even bigger degree: I have tasted alcohol for the first time in my 30s, and it was on my own accord. Until then, everyone around me respected that I didn't want to try anything. And after it, everyone still respects that I will be choosing my next sip of whatever. Now, during my ""tasting alcohol for the first time"" experience, I asked for exactly one drop of it, and I got a fifth of the glass instead, but everyone was fine with me wasting the rest.

The same way, peer pressure may or may not play a role into someone tasting alcohol for the first time, but comparing this experience to kidnapping and sexual abuse of a trafficked victim is dishonest, dangerous and harmful, and I will be grateful if you never compare them to each other again.",RafeHaab,e3h7l5r,1533223245,4,,9
22899,e3h7l5r,"If the brothel is regulated and subject to no-notice periodic inspections then how is it easier to hide a trafficked person?  Wouldn’t a simple law/regulation be: sex workers at a brothel must have American citizenship and have a proficiency in English?

Example:  An inspector visits a legal brothel for an audit.  There are 4 sex workers at the brothel and there are 2 new workers there that day.  The two new workers are not American citizens and do not speak English at all.  The brothel is violating the law/regulation.  The authorities are notified and the brothel is shutdown.  

The brothel is a business.  Businesses are required to follow state/federal regulations and laws.  Businesses keep records of their employees and also set requirements on what is required of their employees for employment.  I’m also sure that a good number of sex workers would likely pursue unionization.   

I honestly believe that legalizing brothels themselves would provide a safer environment for sex workers/reduce human trafficking because of the oversight from inspectors and with the implementation of the right laws/regulations.

22900,e3h7l5r,"&gt; If the brothel is regulated and subject to no-notice periodic inspections then how is it easier to hide a trafficked person?

Easy!: ""you'll say you are here willingly or you/your family back home will be in grave danger""

Don't think for a second traffic victims will rat their captors on a whim. They ALL want to get out of that situation, but these people are complete monsters. They have these women acquire huge debts to them, abuse them into submission before renting them to the public (much like dog fighting rings do the dogs before they take them to their first fight), and usually threaten their families (parent/siblings) or hold their children for ransom if they happen to get pregnant due to unprotected sex (that is, of course, if the woman is otherwise healthy and can carry to term without medical intervention and the trafficker has connections to pedophilia to warrant keeping the child) or force them to get abortions, further breaking the woman's will. It's not easy for a captive woman to trust her safety to strangers, even if they are police/people who can rescue them.

&gt; The brothel is a business.

Yes, it is. But so is the tobacco industry, and you can't tell me it's a moral business with a straight face.

You know what else is a businness? The taxi guild in my country. You know what they do to suspected uber contractors? They destroy their cars, unpunished. All you have to do is spray-paint ""uber"" on a random car, and watch them destroy it within three days.

22901,e3h7l5r,"Ok, first off you missed what I said about one of the laws/regulations being:   “Must have their American Citizenship”.  That’s a big one and last I checked victims of human trafficking aren’t brought into the country legally.  Doesn’t matter if they say they are here willingly; no citizenship then they can’t work there.  Thus, red flags would go up for the inspector.  Since it would be suspected human trafficking at that point the business would be shutdown, the owner/manager arrested, the workers interviewed, and those suspected of being victims would be cared for by the UCIS.  All of this would lead to the deterrent of human trafficking. 

Think about it:  You are an American citizen and decide to open open a brothel.  You go through all of the permits, red tape, etc just to start the business.  Are you really going to risk everything and go to jail for human trafficking when there are plenty of women that would work at your business that are American citizens or have earned their citizenship?  I hardly think anyone would because it’s stupid.  Would a few people be that dumb?  Sure they would but not nearly as many as you seem to think.

I know. All I'm asking is that they don't break things for everyone else.

&gt; is it the US’ fault that your country has corruption issues?

Actually, it is. Some declassificed documents have proven the US intefered with my country's development. And also, there's this: I world war 2, my country stayed neutral and sold food, among others, to the UK and US. And both of them acquired huge debts with my country. And they solved this by agreeing the US would forgive the debt the UK had with them if the UK paid their debt with Argentina (which I assume was much less). All three countries agreed, and then... The UK falsely declared bankrupcy, leaving my country nothing to show for its services. Since our army has always been much smaller than the UK's, we couldn't simply invade and take what was owed by force.

This is, or at least was, taught to all the children back when I was underage. The fact is that you don't become a global superpower by playing nice. You do so by bending the rules to their limit and having a big army. 

&gt; If it is then as a US citizen I apologize to you as a fellow human.

Thank you, I appreciate that. Please pay attention to your country's politics and be on the look for foul play on other countries (no, Trump's wall doesn't qualify as foul play, I can tell you first hand uncontrolled inmigration is troublesome).

&gt; Our government does things at times that a majority of us do not support. This is the problem with most countries but from the US it sometimes is more common.

I agree. Look, my country is deep in debt, and the last loan came with a condition: legalize abortion nationwide. This is your chance to right some wrongs and out this filthy trick.

&gt; If corruption in your country is such a huge problem then how are the people trying to combat it?

We can't, actually. Crime has been legalised in practice, even if it remains illegal on paper. And racism. With one condition: You must not be white. As an example, if I were to kill my husband, I would go to prison. But if an impoverished migrant or any of his descendants did it, I would be left a widow with no compensation or even justice, even if I saw the murderer do it and remembered his face and features perfectly. Social justice started in the US, and since it was imposed here, non-whites are victims of society by default and can do no wrong. Couple that with high corruption, and you get leaders who use these migrant pedigrees to obtain votes despite what the actual taxpaying citizens want. Honeswt people are no longer the majority, and if you think ""welfare queens"" are an US pandemic, multiply it by a million and make that welfare unconditional (as in, no need to prove you are looking for a job, or even that you have commited no crimes).

&gt; Do they have leaders in the government actively helping to oust the corrupt?

Nope. Last elections it seemed like we would finally get an honest president, but he was simply a better liar, like we have never seen before. And the woman before him set the ""big liar"" bar really, really high, so that's a big ""accomplishment"" of him.

And now he has betrayed the last thing that we still believed about him: that he was pro-life. In this regard, you are lucky you have Trump. His big ego is not preventing him from trying to fulfill his promises. Because our president is willing to sacrifice the next generation (unless you are poor and non-white, of course, in which case he needs your vote and your 14 children's too) if that keeps him in power.

Why? Because the quicker educated people die off, the sooner it will become easy to funnel money discretely into their own pockets. Malnourished people don't make for good lie detectors.

And if my comment sounds racist to anyone, remember this: I'm not doing any of what I described. Or even white argentinians; We aren't at fault. Our vote doesn't count anymore since we have the lowest fertility rate of the entire population since three generations ago and are no longer a majority, and we are too busy working 12 hours a day or longer to make a living.

In my perfect world there would be no borders or governmental corruption or racism or any other ugly thing that is in any society.  Unfortunately those things have been present since the dawn of civilization and they will likely never change.

If the US changes a domestic law for its people and your country decides to change the same law to mimic the US but neglects to properly regulate it and to protect the workers then that is your countries fault not the United States fault.

The thing is that I can’t expect everything other countries do to be good for my country just as you cannot expect what the US or China does to not affect your country. 

Here’s an example:  I buy a new truck and only drive it to work and back home.  A person in another town I drive through on my way to work sees me driving and likes my truck.  They buy one too but decided to drink and drive resulting in an accident.  That accident isn’t my fault.  It’s the person that decided to drive drunk.  

In regards to the US, I think that properly regulated brothels would be a good thing to protect our sex workers.  I think with sensible regulations and laws it would also curb sex trafficking in the US.  

Unfortunately, if some countries followed the US and legalized brothels but failed to protect the workers or make laws against trafficking then it would likely make their problems with those issues worse.  ",john1979af,e3ibae3,1533256967,1,e3i8944,9

It is a truth. Nothing to be sorry about.

&gt; Here’s an example:

And here's another: An olympic athlete jumps from a ten meters trampoline. A child who sees him tries to mimic his feat a week later on that same pool. Not the man's fault, of course, but it's the club's fault. They should have made sure to close the place for the competition instead of allowing club members and their families to remain in a smaller pool a few meters away. OR they could have made sure to remove/block the ladder so eager toddlers couldn't climb it.

With this I mean to say that you either have the UN intervene and block any attempt to legalise prostitution in any country, or allow it under their supervision and tight control (so the ""toddler"" doesn't tumble backwards into an empty pool).

Right now, the UN is mostly useless, but this coud be changed if the US government is pressured into making it work. Because let's be honest: You are the only country with any kind of power over that organization.",RafeHaab,e3iczhz,1533258613,1,e3ibae3,9

Underfunded: 

*94 percent of public school teachers in the United States reported paying for supplies without reimbursement in the school year that straddled 2014 and 2015*

*The teachers who reported spending their own money on supplies shelled out $479 each on average, according to the survey. Seven percent reported spending more than $1,000.*

How often is your wife given this $300 for supplies?  Monthly?  Quarterly?  Annually?  

https://thejournal.com/articles/2017/08/08/report-teachers-spend-up-to-5000-out-of-pocket-on-classroom-supplies.aspx

*more than a third of teachers (36 percent) shop ""every few months"" for supplies and materials for their classes, and another 28 percent shop every month. Just 22 percent load up all of their shopping before the school year starts*

Unless that stipend is at least quarterly, statistics say she will pay out of pocket for supplies before the year is over.

Underpaid:

http://www.nea.org/home/12661.htm

*Not only do teachers start lower than other professionals, but the more years they put into teaching, the wider the gap gets.*

*A report from NEA Research, which is based on US census data, finds that annual pay for teachers has fallen sharply over the past 60 years in relation to the annual pay of other workers with college degrees. Throughout the nation the average earnings of workers with at least four years of college are now over 50 percent higher than the average earnings of a teacher.*

*An analysis of weekly wage trends by researchers at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) shows that teachers' wages have fallen behind those of other workers since 1996, with teachers' inflation-adjusted weekly wages rising just 0.8%, far less than the 12% weekly wage growth of other college graduates and of all workers. Further, a comparison of teachers' weekly wages to those of other workers with similar education and experience shows that, since 1993, female teacher wages have fallen behind 13% and male teacher wages 12.5% (11.5% among all teachers). Since 1979 teacher wages relative to those of other similar workers have dropped 18.5% among women, 9.3% among men, and 13.1% among both combined.*

Is your view that the article harms the fight for higher teacher wages, or that teachers are not, in reality, underpaid and underfunded?  Because even though your title specifically refers to the optics of Hope Brown's situation, it sounds like you're adverse to simply the suggestion according to your actual CMV.  The numbers don't lie.  Teachers are underpaid compared to similarly educated fields, and not only is per-student funding dropping on average across the country, teachers overwhelmingly are forced to pay out of pocket for supplies.  While the study above does not comment on this, I'm sure your wife is not one of only 6% of teachers nationwide with a supply stipend, so I think it's fair to assume many of that 94% also have a supply stipend- it's just simply not enough.",sam_hammich,e662vy2,1537234124,1,,4

Almost everyone in our society contributes to paying taxes and gay people (or whoever) should not be forced to contribute to paying for the infrastructure that allows those private entities to do business and earn a profit.

&gt;Are you saying that businesses don't pay for that use?

If they were *private* businesses, then they should not have to rely on public infrastructure in order to do business. IMO, it is theft to take money from someone (in the form of taxes) and to not give them consideration (a product or service) in return.

If the businesses choose to use public resources, then they should be required to do business with any member of the public. The only other options are to allow people to direct their tax dollars away from these businesses, or for these businesses to move entirely to private land and private infrastructure.

27362,d1wc3m2,"Im not going to argue that Islam is good. Im trying to build doubt in you that its entirety of the religion thats bad instead of a particular ideology within the beliefsystem of islam. 

If you dont feel like reading my opinion at least read the [speech](http://www.friedenspreis-des-deutschen-buchhandels.de/445651/?mid=1042759)  
as it gives some more insight in the topic.


&gt;&gt;I also will reject any arguments to the true meaning of the Quran or misunderstanding/mistranslations

So you hold a belief, and not an opinion on matters concering the true meaning of the Quran? If not you should feel free to accept the premise that there might be different interpretations of the same text. 

&gt;&gt;If many people misunderstand the teachings of the Quran, then Islam is at fault because the actions are what matters.

To reiterate upon this point: christians thought it was okay that the Bible was written in Latin and could only be read by priests for about 1500 years. 
Were they wrong? Maybe. From our prespective: yes sure. We all should be able to read it and form our ideas from it. This does mean that those people how tought religious ideology and faith at that time wanted people to live in a particular way. Not that it is a necessity the religion expects.

To make the case that this is also valid in Islam I'm going to quote from a speech of a Irani German intellectual, Navid Kermani who studied orientology in Kairo. Its worth reading the entire [speech](http://www.friedenspreis-des-deutschen-buchhandels.de/445651/?mid=1042759) but it has a different main theme. (emphasis mine)

&gt;Let me illustrate the loss of creativity and freedom in the context of my own field: there was a time when it was conceivable, and even taken for granted, that the Quran is a poetic text which can only be grasped using the tools and methods of literary studies, no differently than a poem.

so there might be reason to agree with my premise from above.

&gt;It was conceivable and taken for granted that a theologian was at the same time a literary scholar and an expert on poetry, and in many cases a poet himself. 

The Quran ought to have another meaning. 

&gt;In our time, my own teacher Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd in Cairo was charged with heresy, [...] because he conceived Quranic studies as a form of literary scholarship. In other words, an approach to the Quran which was once taken for granted, and for which Nasr Abu Zayd was able to cite the **most important scholars of classical Islamic theology**, is no longer even acknowledged as thinkable. 

The problem with current islam is the people who are teaching it.
And with those who dont feel the need to openly oppose them and combat the detrumental and dangerous ideology of current whahabi islam.


&gt;&gt;Causation matters! This is a big one for me and is probably the part I'm least sure about, so be sure to think about it. I'm willing to accept that Islam is not to blame if it can be shown that the problems I have happen independent of religion.

Well yes and no. People, as said before, interpret things differently and the lack of action by many people in the past century lead to what we face now.  
In the past people used Islam as a basis for cultural rutuals and combined there regional culture with that of Islam. This is what gave us

&gt;writings of the mystics, philosophers, rhetoricians and theologians. [...] the intellectual scope, the aesthetic power and the great humanity we find in the spirituality of Ibn Arabi, the poetry of Rumi, the historiography of Ibn Khaldun, the poetic theology of Abd al-Qahir al-Jurjani, the philosophy of Averroes, the travel reports of Ibn Battuta; and in the tales of the Thousand and One Nights, which are worldly – yes, worldly and erotic, and feminist too, incidentally, and at the same time infused with the spirit and the verses of the Quran on every page.  

The Quran and Islam with it wasn't only used for evil. It did work. But right now.

&gt; None of this can be found in the religious culture of modern Islam, nothing whatsoever that is even remotely comparable, that is as fascinating, as profound as the writings I came across as a student. To say nothing of Islamic architecture, Islamic art or Islamic musicology: they no longer exist.

The question is now: makes this change Islam intrinsically bad? 

I don't think so.

The main problem that we face with Islam is not that it is intrinsically bad but that there are main stream ideologies floating around which don't permit any muslim to question their teachings, which dont permit muslims to interpret their religion how they want. Which don't permit muslims to critizise any part of islam. 

&gt; The love of one’s own – one’s own culture, one’s own country and also one’s own person – manifests itself in self-criticism. 

And right now we are missing self-criticism or rather we are missing a state where self-criticism is permitted without certain death in some muslim countries because those ideologies had way too long time to spead in those countries.

And these thoughts and this ideology is speading towards us, which is the reason you are aware of its existence.
They are attractive to young people in europe for various reasons you can firgure out for yourself. And many people will see different reasons, and many people will disagree with everything that can be said over why it is attractive to young people in the west.

Still this ideology is the opposite of what Islam was prior to the establishment of radical rules.

&gt; we also know it is not just in Iraq and Syria that the world is strictly divided into what is forbidden and what is permitted – and humanity divided into believers and unbelievers.

But all over the islamic world. 

&gt;A school of thought that declares all people of other religions heretics, and berates, terrorises, vilifies and insults them, has been promulgated for decades, sponsored with billions from oil production, in mosques, in books and on television. If you denigrate other people systematically, day after day, it is only logical – how well we know this from our own history, from German history – that you will end up declaring their lives worthless. That such a religious fascism has become conceivable at all, that IS is able to recruit so many fighters, and still more sympathisers, that it has been able to overrun entire countries and capture major cities with hardly a fight – this is not the beginning, but rather the endpoint to date of a long decline, and I am referring not least to the decline of religious thought.

This is the main argument. They despise religion. Those fundamentalist fascist despise the icons of their own religion. Their hatred for everything that does not confirm their narrow belief is beyond comprehension.

&gt;One might have thought that the religious fundamentalists [...] would have valued at least their own culture. Yet the opposite was the case: by seeking to return to a supposed point of origin, **they not only neglected Islamic tradition, but resolutely fought** it. We are only surprised by Islamic State’s acts of iconoclasm because we never noticed that there are virtually no ancient relics left in Saudi Arabia. In Mecca, the Wahhabis have destroyed the tombs and mosques of the Prophet’s closest kin, including the house he was born in. The historic mosque of the Prophet in Medina has been replaced with a colossal new building, and on the site where, until a few years ago, the house of Muhammad and his wife Khadija stood, there is now a public toilet.

Islamic culture has imploded and we are witnessing the end right now. If you think that those, who are alienate their own religion so far from its culture are the true representatives for it, you may keep your view. If however you see that there are more than one ideologies who disguise themselves under then name of islam while fighting the centuries old core of islam you should see that we are not seeing islam as the worst religon right now. We are seeing a perverted mixture of hatred filled facist ideology mixed with a fundamental religious ideology. And we are seeing how Islam is fighting it. 

We are seeing how Islam is attacked by this perverse mixture that will use violence against everyone because they see their lives as worthless.  
We are seeing how people are trying to fight this ideology, in the name of Islam.   
We are maybe witnessing the end of Islam how we should know it.  
And how our children and grandchildren will know it.  
We are witnessing the destruction of a centuries old faith for one reason alone.

May the power of love be greater than the power of hatred.

If countries just allow whomever to live where they please, without any checks, there will *always* be conflict. Of course you could say that conflict is inevitable anyway, but large, unchecked increases in an outside population has historically caused violent conflict.

By stopping immigration, you are affectively stopping the number of people accepting these work visas and America simply does not have the educated working class it requires as education is too expensive. I think that focusing on ""Mexicans taking our jerbs"" is just a focused upon viewpoint that trump exasperated, as he cannot build this wall in any way, and the mexican immigration rate has gone down. ""Between 2006 and 2010, the number of Mexican immigrants increased by 200,000 compared to the more than 2 million who arrived in the five years prior - http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/mexican-immigrants-united-states
Immigration to the U.S. has been halted by all accounts, and simply focusing on Mexicans is what we call racist, because nothing else is ever mentioned when the issue is so much broader. And if you're going to call them lies, please elaborate, what were the lies. I'm not asking for all your time ever, but simply calling her a liar is not enough objective proof for me.

If a certain group of people set out to manipulate the group discussion by leveraging those flaws (using fear as a strategy to spread false information and to promote racism and other forms of us vs them)  then the well intentioned discussion is completely undermined.

It’s a bit like if we are all playing a card game and one guy is cheating.

While someone who supports net neutrality for pragmatic purposes (i.e. motivated by concern that their preferred communications will be restricted) would accept this, someone in favour of the principle of net neutrality, that ISPs should have no say over content, would not.

Furthermore, even if we were to accept that the principle of neutrality should only apply to genuinely-held opinion, many users of Reddit do genuinely hold the views that they reached via Russian-sourced political-messaging, even if they are then re-sharing said messaging, satisfying this requirement.

32343,dw2upvj,"I think that the gun debate is a good example of a controversial issue where conservatives tend to be more educated than liberals. Liberals are notorious for passing gun legislation that makes no sense if you actually know how guns work. Note: I am aware that the classic definition of a liberal isn’t necessarily opposed to guns, but I feel that the modern mainstream definition of a liberal is less gun friendly than a modern mainstream conservative. 

A recent example of misguided legislation is states that have banned bump stocks. Bump stocks actually *decrease* the accuracy of a gun and therefore make it less lethal than an unmodified gun. However, they were still banned in some places largely because one happened to be used in the Vegas mass shooting. 

Another example is the focus on rifles and long guns in general by liberal politicians and party members. [According to the FBI’s statistics](https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2014/crime-in-the-u.s.-2014/tables/expanded-homicide-data/expanded_homicide_data_table_8_murder_victims_by_weapon_2010-2014.xls), over twice as many people are murdered every year with fists and feet as are murdered with rifles. But it sure wouldn’t seem so with the intense focus placed on AR-15s and other semi-automatic rifles. And if you look at the handgun murders, they’re WAY higher than any long gun! But liberal politicians and policies often focus more on rifles and so-called “assault weapons” than they do on handguns.

Now, to be clear - I don’t necessarily agree with every conservative position on guns either. I do think that there are some regulations on guns that make sense, and I support those regardless of the liberal or conservative position. That being said, I’ve generally found that when I disagree with a conservative position, it isn’t because the conservative Im speaking with is uneducated. It’s more often because of differences in our senses of morality and our opinions on the importance of different things, rather than due to ignorance. Usually they know what they’re talking about - it’s just that we disagree on what that implies.

To sum things up, I think that guns are a good example where conservatives tend to be more educated on the subject than liberals do. Evidence for this are the numerous cases of liberals misusing terminology, misunderstanding the mechanics of how a gun works, and a general scale of focus that doesn’t line up with the scale of the problem. I hope that this example can convince you that at least once in a while, the conservatives aren’t the uneducated ones. ",[deleted],dw3276j,1521684842,173,dw2v6mh,9

Well there is a very good reason for that because while everyone living on the streets are a high risk group, homeless women in particular are often victims of assault. For example, 92% of a large, racially diverse sample of homeless mothers had experienced severe physical and/or sexual violence at some point in their lives (Browne &amp; Bassuk, 1997) And as there are differences between the sexes in terms of their physique, women living on the street have a different level of need for protection.

- What if the reason for independence is distinctly awful? The southern states in the American civil war seceded because they wanted to preserve slavery. Should we have honored their right to independence even though it was for a really terrible reason?

Which suggests that you believe toxic masculinity is a term used to describe men who are masculine to the extreme without much balance - or in your terms 'overly masculine'.

Then you say:

&gt; that I was promoting negative ideas about women 

You seem to direct the conversation into a different direction about you being abused by a woman and then spurting bad things about women. But what does that have to do with your previous definition of toxic masculinity? It doesn't. You haven't written anywhere that toxic masculinity has some thing to do with being abused by a woman and then having negative opinions about women.

Similarly, when you say,

&gt;We don't accuse female rape victims who don't trust men of having ""Toxic Femininity,"" so why would we do it to men?

Let's twist it this way: would you argue that men who were raped by women and distrust women because of this, exemplify toxic masculinity? I'd hope not, since you go against your *own* definition if you did. Your definition is that toxic masculinity is having to do with ""overly masculine"" traits. Conversely, toxic femininity should have to do with ""overly feminine"" traits. What about femininity when pushed to the extreme encourages distrust? To me, that is what 'toxic femininity' should be: when the 'ideal' image of a woman is pushed to the extreme limits such that it is harmful. So, one can argue that toxic femininity would have to do with extreme passivity and extreme vanity etc.. Basically, toxic femininity should be the ""damsel in distress"" persona.

&gt;The term Toxic Masculinity isn't helpful because these are insecurities either brought out by abuse, or they are amoral actions caused by mental illness.

Really? I'm not so sure about that. When boys are encouraged to fight at a young age, are they considered sociopaths or some one who embraces the masculine ideal of a rugged strong domaninant being?

At the end of the day, although arguably extreme masculinity and extreme femininity are both bad, extreme masculinity is more damaging to others. Extreme femininity is making yourself powerless and itemized whereas extreme masculinity actually makes you more powerful by pushing others down and violently if need be. Therefore, toxic masculinity is a more known term.

You said: Toxic Masculinity - The theory that men have a problem with being overly masculine to the point of being abusers, rapists, deny help for themselves, dominate those who are considered weak, and be peer pressured into amoral things via groups of other men.

Then you said that 

&gt;But these are both signs of abuse. There's no way to define either of these things without already having to ignore other more specific definitions. 

What exactly is a sign of abuse? Can you elaborate? Is it that ""damsel in distress"" syndrome-d women have been abused or are abusers? I don't really get where you're going with this.

&gt;We should use the specifics rather than a broad term that is used to slander men.

You see, this is where I disagree. I don't have a problem with people calling out the ""damsel in distress"" women for who they are. Or even calling it ""toxic femininity"". I don't take it as an assault towards all women and certainly nothing towards me - and there's a reason why,  I have never been one of those women and never will be. I realize that certain elements of femininity encouraged for 'traditional' women are toxic to oneself and others *when taken to the extreme* . Heck, I just listed them

1. vanity
2. passivity
3. restrictment to only ""women"" jobs

This is self-awareness. 

Similarly, I can easily see (and have seen) issues when masculinity is taken to the extreme. Just look at games like GTA which have hyper-masculine chest thumping violent characters.

I think that you are taking this too personally, honestly. But I don't want to blame you.

I think the other comparison that I have is for occasional drinkers and alcoholics. It's totally okay if you are an occasional drinker but not so much if you are an alcoholic. Thinks taken in extremes are typically not good.

&gt;Toxic Blackness because they are taught to steal and be poor

Where are they taught to steal and be poor? That's the thing though: everywhere you look, in African American culture, you will see the opposite. Just look at hip hop - it doesn't glorify being poor. For one, if you hear lyrics like ""I got dollaz in my wallet"" then you know it has nothing to do with being poor. It is about coming from a poor background and making it rich. 

The socioeconomic position of African Americans was largely influenced by the institutional discrimination up until modern day. It's not some ""taught"" thing. 



Edit: I can't believe I didn't mention this earlier but haven't you considered the fact that there are feminine men and masculine women? Typically people exhibit a combination of the two. There becomes a dis balance if one is to one extreme. So associating masculinity only with men is not entirely accurate since there are masculine women.",chem4u,d4zaios,1467669992,3,d4z500y,8

The damsel in distress trope, in particular, would be a sign or either Cluster C or another kind of personality disorder. It's actually emotional manipulation to appear helpless in order to receive help.

&gt;I don't have a problem with people calling out the ""damsel in distress"" women for who they are. Or even calling it ""toxic femininity"". 

I'm a very active MRA and I've only see one person in my entire life outside of the conversation I had with my friend about Toxic Femininity and it was a parody of Toxic Masculinity. Yet Toxic Masculinity is a core foundation of Feminism. This not only is not representative of reality, but it's purposely misleading. There's a reason why I'm on a throw away account. Even suggesting this would destroy me. Yet you're on your main account. You're not afraid to talk about calling masculinity toxic. That should tell you who has the power.

&gt;Just look at games like GTA which have hyper-masculine chest thumping violent characters.

And Tetris is the most popular game of all time, does this mean we're all being taught to be Russian?

&gt;I think that you are taking this too personally, honestly. But I don't want to blame you.

I am male and people are telling me that men are toxic, hyper-masculine, chest thumping, violent people. You're damn right I'm taking it personal.

We have evidence that IPV is common between both sexes nearly equally. And in fact, some reported violence agaisnt women is started by the women being violent and then the man defending himself, only to be arrested by the police thanks to the Deluth model which is still used today in the United States as an acceptable way to conduct investigations.

Not to mention that if a man is beaten by his wife in public, no one bats an eye, and they'll even laugh at him. But if a women is beaten in public, everyone loses their shit and starts attacking the abuser.

Can you explain what you mean?

&gt;Virtually all rank and file republicans have an erroneous, simplistic, myopic view of the world. They like their simple, comfortable world with bad guys and good guys. Many democrats have a myopic and simplistic view of the world too, but it is less erroneous (anti-GMO/vaccine/nuclear zealots notwithstanding).

After spending years arguing with leftists on reddit, I can tell you that the vast majority of them have a view of the world that is almost entirely based on emotional pleas, baseless assertions and sometimes prejudice against white people, old people, rich people, or republicans.

&gt;A depressing amount of republicans hate liberals and educated people such as university professors. They refuse to believe that higher learning truly is valuable and do not accept that the ""liberal elites"" are more qualified to make policies than they are.

What republicans hate is elitism. They hate a few people confidently imposing rules from the top down on millions of people. Universities have become a pretty strong figurehead for that, and for liberal elitism in general, with professors being wildly leftwing. If you don't believe that liberal policies work, why would you believe liberal elites are more qualified to make policies? Isn't that the issue? That they don't agree with them?

&gt;Not only that, but they resent and despise those more literate and informed than they are and care more about settling imaginary scores with their caricatural views of them than anything else.

Republicans are probably not interested enough in intellectualism, and liberals are far far far too obsessed with the appearance of it. What matters is if the ideas are better, and so far none of what you're saying is about ideas. You're just attacking people with vague insults.

&gt;A substantial amount of republicans AND, to a lesser degree, democrats cannot distinguish between baseless smears/fake news and facts.

Because they've been basically locked out by a media and academia that are left leaning beyond normalcy given the general population and beyond what is reasonable to conclude about the issues. Where do you want them to go when the ""credible"" and ""official"" channels are either lying to them, or giving them propaganda, or at best giving them a liberal-biased version of whatever it is they're telling them?

&gt;Republican politicians are in the pockets of the wealthy and truly do not care if the poor die in the street or if the middle class is destroyed. Their behavior is evil by their own moral standards. Only the rich and their immediate family and friends truly matter to them.

I mean come on. Are you even being serious here? You're assigning motive to people you know nothing about. I'm waiting for where in your post you actually make *arguments* instead of slinging hyperbolic insults with nothing to back it up.

&gt;Over 33% of the population are willing to tolerate racism as long as it's not aimed at them. This number percentage is significantly higher amongst white people.

Can you provide a source for this? I'm having trouble understanding what point you're trying to make. It seems very contrived and not really relevant. It wouldn't surprise me if white people care less about racism in general than minority groups.

&gt;the election of Donald Trump.

which is a result of posts like this.

&gt;the inexorable economic decline of industrial rural america.

Which is due to technology and automation, none of the insults you just made about republicans.

&gt;the countless comments and insults I've seen hurled at liberals (liberals don't have equivalents to libtard or cuck or behavior such as ""rolling coal"").

You just wrote a huge post dedicated to calling republicans racists and stupid. And if you think leftwing phrases like that don't exist, go visit /r/politics

&gt;Vote tallies for Donald Trump, who has made countless racist, sexist and bigoted comments, exhibited racism in a documented fashion (housing discrimination).

Another example of republicans being less likely to care about the appearance of these things. Donald trump was an extremely unliked candidate, even when he was elected. This says that republicans voted for him pragmatically, despite those things. Maybe you think saying stupid shit should automatically disqualify you no matter what, but obviously people disagree with you. That doesn't make them racist, sexist or bigoted.

&gt;People who vote republican despite the fact it is factually against their own interest (repealing obamacare, tax cuts for the rich are harmful according to the CBO).

Do you not get the irony? You are the *perfect* example of what they hate. You just said that repealing obamacare is factually against their interest. How in the fucking **world** do you call that a fact? How in the fucking **world** are you going to claim it's a fact that cutting taxes (for basically everybody) is going to be against their own interest. You realize the CBO is only looking at the *budget*, right? That it's not looking at all possible direct and indirect effects of having a low tax, low regulation environment? This is a great example of what's wrong with the left's obsession with the appearance of facts and intellectualism. The CBO has numbers, and numbers are good!

&gt; The estate tax only applies to the top 2/10 of 1 percent.

Exactly. The money gained is negligible, and discourages people from earning more money, and doing things to duck the tax. 

&gt; Plus cutting the tax doesn’t add to the economy since the tax doesn’t kick in until they die.

Yeah, it does. People know it's there, and therefore do things to duck it. Move it off-shore, buy assets etc etc. All of that hurts the economy when that money would do better here working in the system.

Not that much to be honest. It's a fraction of a percent of the revenue. ",Priddee,dzfan38,1527044643,2,,5

41438,dzfan38,"&gt; Are you being willfully obtuse or can you really not ~~comprhend~~ comprehend that the estate tax would enable the country to only have to find 3/4 of the tuition for all students somewhere else?

It's not tuition for all students. It's only for public schools. And it will most likely hurt private universities, of which are the most amazing prestigious universities in the world. It's also an awesome way to make sure that there is no growth and development in the quality of the schools. It also is shown to lower graduation rates and increase drop out rates. We also have a problem here that we don't have enough people in the trades, so free college makes this way worse. It really only benefits the top percent of kids who get the best high school educations, and access to programs colleges then want to see. If everyone is free, they'll only want the best kids, and those are the rich kids on paper.

Free college sounds like sunshine and rainbows but in reality, it has some pretty nasty effects. England tried this and once they got rid of it, so much better results.  

We should focus on fixing our public school system which is an abomination. 


&gt; BTW, in reality what is going to happen is that without the estate tax our budget deficit will actually just grow by billions of dollars a year, making our country go further into debt.

Again, there are other ways to raise government revenue besides an estate tax. Believe it or not, a good chunk of the time taxes were lowered in the US, it's led to more government revenue collected. Which means more money for social programs and projects. And increases in taxes can actually lower government revenue. So less money for programs, and a bigger deficit.  


&gt; You mean reduce their estate tax burden.

Yes, move money away from the open market and US to avoid the tax. 

&gt; If what you are saying is true about it being easily ducked than it would not be a problem to keep. Your stance is illogical.

When people duck it, it takes money out of the US markets, which could go to fund loans for people to start businesses, fund a scholarship, find the next breakthrough, lead to wage increases and bonuses for deserving people, and overall grow the economy and make everyone better off. 

Instead, rich people dump all their money overseas to sit and do nothing just to avoid the death tax. It's getting worse and worse too, the death tax collected double the portion of government revenues in 1990 as it does now. Making people in the US worse off. 

Your stance is illogical. You want to hurt the American economy by keeping this pointless tax that people duck anyway to raise government revenues by 0.06%. That's half of one percent. Or you could let people keep the money, and do stuff with it to help grow the economy. 

To put some context, the Tax Foundation, the countries leading tax policy non-profit estimates that estate tax elimination would increase the size of the economy by 0.8 %, boost investment by 2.2%  and lead to 139,000 new jobs. 

Boosting GDP by 0.8% means 550 billion dollars. Which blows the measly 19 billion out of the water by about 30x. That's not accounting for the ~140,000 jobs and increase to investment.

&gt; If it was not effective it would not create substantial revenue

It doesn't. It accounts for barely a half of one percent of government revenues. So it's not effective. 


&gt; It's also not punishing people for dying. It is asking people to pay their share of income they receive when they ~~inherent~~ inherit money.

Lol, it's most certainly not asking. 



&gt; It also encourages people to spend their money instead of saving if for generations which greatly benefits the economy and benefits charities greatly. Your stance is the petty one.

75% of all inheritance regardless of size is completely gone within 2 generations. 90% of it gone by 3 generations. So it's not saving it for long. It's spent domestically, instead of hidden in loopholes and offshore accounts.

If you don't define it like that, what you end up with are statements like 140 IQ medieval peasant is more intelligent than 130 IQ modern day doctor, and for that reason I can't accept it.

If you took a poll of men's ideal temperature and women's ideal temperature, crunched the numbers, and found that women prefer warmer temperatures and men prefer hotter, then that's just giving us some info.  If you compare these numbers to an office setting and find that the temperature gravitates toward men's preferences, then that is absolutely inherently sexist.

This doesn't mean that it's akin to telling women they should stay in the kitchen and not vote.  It means that between a few temperatures Fahrenheit, there's a disparity, and one gender prefers one end of the disparity.  It's inherently sexist.  It's just not the big deal you might be making it out to be.

As for clothing, that's a really bad way to go about it.  Air conditioning, especially in the US, is extreme.  People want their offices to be mid-spring weather.  Some places are fucking freezing, even when it's hot outside, and there's no reason for that.  Adjusting the temperature indoors, sometimes to tens of degrees lower, and then telling another gender that they're in the wrong for complaining that it's too cold, is egregious.  Not only would one be controlling the temperature at a large expense to the environment, but it's blowing past the preferences of half the population and telling them they're wrong.
