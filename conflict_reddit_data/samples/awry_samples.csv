121,cuxyheg,"Here's my problem with views like this: Monogamy doesn't work for everyone. That doesn't mean that monogamy is bad, or failed. It just means that some people don't do well while monogamous.
Think of it as a sexual orientation. Some people are straight, some people are gay, some people are bisexual. If being gay is seen as wrong or simply not presented as an option, a lot of bisexual people will be ""straight-by-default."" (e.g they either don't consider same-sex partners as an option or they choose not to have same-sex partners)",Yxoque,cuxyheg_1,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"Some people are only happy in a monogamous relationship. Some people are only happy in polyamorous relationships. Some people are happy in either. The last group will default to monogamy if that is presented as the only acceptable option.
So yes, polyamory of various kinds should be seen as a viable option for more people, but that doesn't devalue the experience of the people who are perfectly happy being monogamous.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_2,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; Marriage rates are at an all time low (not necessarily a correlation, but I'm just pointing it out) and divorce rates are at an all time high.
People who get a divorce still tend to be monogamous. They prefer having a single romantic and sexual partner. Getting divorced doesn't mean that you suck at being monogamous. It just means that you and your partner didn't work out in a monogamous relationship.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_3,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; People always complain about how unhappy they are when they're married/in a long term relationship and how after the chemicals in your brain wear off - you start hating the other person and you get annoyed just by being around them.
This is extremely common in fiction and I wish it wasn't. Especially when it comes to men. It just doesn't match reality for a lot of people. Sure, the ""newly in-love"" chemicals wear off after a couple of months, but they get replaced by other chemicals that allow for a more stable, long-term love. A couple that communicates well probably won't start hating each other and won't get annoyed. Again, individual people breaking up for whatever reason does not devalue monogamy. Some people just aren't made for being together for a long time, but others are. Or the first also were, just not with each other.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_4,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"Worth noting that about a century ago, the trope was reversed: People assumed that a couple with grow to love each other after marriage, even if they weren't in love when they got married.
&gt; Even when you are in those relationships - you lust for other people.
I personally don't, but that ultimately doesn't matter. I just want to point out that this isn't a universal experience.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_5,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"There's also nothing wrong with lusting after other people, even if you are in a committed monogamous relationship. As long as you don't act on that lust (and this really shouldn't be that hard), everything's fine.
&gt; Women want more and more ""alpha"" men to sleep with, men just want more women to sleep
The whole alpha thing is bullshit. And so is the idea that only men just want more women to sleep with. Women also sometimes just want to sleep with more men. People like sex. That shouldn't be a surprising statement. And again, this is not a universal experience. Tons of people are perfectly happy just having sex with one person ever. If you are not amongst those people, you probably shouldn't do monogamy.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_6,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; you can't stop yourself from developing crushes or lusting over people that you find sexually attractive
So? Having a crush does not mean you can't remain in a dedicated monogamous relationship. It's not an impossible hurdle to overcome.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_7,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt;  In fact, every single relationship that I personally know has at least one person who is actively looking to replace the person they're with.
In every single relationship that I personally the people involved are looking to be together as much and as long as possible. Maybe you shouldn't use your personal circle to generalize a population. You tend to select friends with similar traits.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_8,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; And people still tell you that marriage is wonderful and are shocked when they find out that you don't plan to get married. ""You'll grow out of it"" is the most popular response.
Yes. It's wrong for people to assume that all people are cut out for monogamy. Very annoying, I agree. That doesn't mean that for a lot of people, marriage *is* wonderful and fulfilling. Also, don't forget that polyamorous people can still get married. Currently only to one person, but it still happens (and people do have ceremonies to get married to multiple partners, even if they aren't official).",Yxoque,cuxyheg_9,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; It seems like this system only works if you have a way to make sure both parties are unable to leave it and what's the point of pretending monogamy is ""real and beautiful"" when you need to actively force people to do it?
I really don't think this is the case. Monogamy, when done right, is real and beautiful. So is polyamory. People really don't need to be forced. Most people *want* to be in a relationship and if monogamy is the only option, they'll pick a monogamous relationship. The problem isn't monogamy. The probably monogamy being presented as the only viable option.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_10,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; Is polygamy the answer?
Probably not. Polygamy means only men can have multiple (female) partners, which isn't ideal. What you want is a society that doesn't judge people on how many partners someone have, be it one partner or multiple.",Yxoque,cuxyheg_11,1441983400,4,,16
121,cuxyheg,"&gt; Or do we need to do away with the institution of marriage and civil unions all together?
Probably, but that's mostly unrelated to what you are talking about :-)",Yxoque,cuxyheg_12,1441983400,4,,16

First off no. It's not the medical recognition. Medicine has no recognition for personhood. It's just the legal definition that is important. But people who are anti abortion want the law changed. People fight for law changes all the time. Slaves weren't recognized as people for a long time, many races weren't treated as equals, women didn't have the same rights as men, the LBGT community has been most recently fighting for equal rights.

That people see it as murder and murder is bad. It's not some other policy debate like the reasons for or against legalization of marijuana or universal basic income or universal healthcare where there are a lot more things to discuss.

**Really**, though, the problem is multi-faceted.
First, we're really, really bad about dealing with mental health. What I mean by this is that nearly all of the shooters, by definition, had some problem that resulted in them shooting up multiple innocent people. A big part of that is feeling isolated, depressed, and a series of other mental health related (see: not necessary psychiatric) problems that played a big, big role in them doing this.

In contrast, women don't have many of these problem - they have their own - and we're talking near-exclusively about women's problems but not men's, particularly as they relate to mental health and unmet needs (connection, romance, fulfillment, etc.).

Fourth, we also have gun owners who are legitimately concerned with gun control given example states like California, where they banned cosmetic features of AR-15s, which are very easy to bypass, and have literally no effect upon the lethality or efficacy of the rifle.

**Myths about gun control**
1. Guns don't kill people, people kill people.
&gt;law professor Franklin Zimring found that the circumstances of gun and knife assaults are quite similar: They're typically unplanned and with no clear intention to kill. Offenders use whatever weapon is at hand, and having a gun available makes it more likely that the victim will die. **This helps explain why, even though the United States has overall rates of violent crime in line with rates in other developed nations, our homicide rate is, relatively speaking, off the charts.**
2. Gun laws affect only law-abiding citizens.",daimposter,dw0lshy_11,1521581738,1,duhfv5j,90
17756,dugce0r,"&gt; But law enforcement benefits from stronger gun laws across the board. Records on gun transactions can help solve crimes and track potentially dangerous individuals............... gun laws provide police with a tool to keep these high-risk people from carrying guns; without these laws, the number of people with prior records who commit homicides could be even higher
3. When more households have guns for self-defense, crime goes down.",daimposter,dw0lshy_12,1521581738,1,duhfv5j,90
17756,dugce0r,"&gt; The key question is whether the self-defense benefits of owning a gun outweigh the costs of having more guns in circulation. And the costs can be high: more and cheaper guns available to criminals in the ""secondary market"" -- including gun shows and online sales -- which is almost totally unregulated under federal laws, and increased risk of a child or a spouse misusing a gun at home. Our research suggests that as many as 500,000 guns are stolen each year in the United States, going directly into the hands of people who are, by definition, criminals.
&gt;The data show that a net increase in household gun ownership would mean more homicides and perhaps more burglaries as well. Guns can be sold quickly, and at good prices, on the underground market.
4. In high-crime urban neighborhoods, guns are as easy to get as fast food.",daimposter,dw0lshy_13,1521581738,1,duhfv5j,90
17756,dugce0r,"&gt;Surveys of people who have been arrested find that a majority of those who didn't own a gun at the time of their arrest, but who would want one, say it would take more than a week to get one. Some people who can't find a gun on the street hire a broker in the underground market to help them get one. It costs more and takes more time to get guns in the underground market -- evidence that gun regulations do make some difference.

&gt;* A 1993 nationwide survey of 4,977 households found that over the previous five years, at least 0.5% of households had members who had used a gun for defense during a situation in which they thought someone “almost certainly would have been killed” if they “had not used a gun for protection.” This amounted to 162,000 such incidents per year. This excludes all “military service, police work, or work as a security guard.”[19]
&gt;* Based on survey data from a 2000 study published in the Journal of Quantitative Criminology,[24] U.S. civilians use guns to defend themselves and others from crime at least 989,883 times per year.[25]
&gt;* A 1994 survey conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that Americans use guns to frighten away intruders who are breaking into their homes about 498,000 times per year.[27]
&gt;“Studies that directly assessed the effect of actual defensive uses of guns (i.e., incidents in which a gun was ‘used’ by the crime victim in the sense of attacking or threatening an offender) have found consistently lower injury rates among gun-using crime victims compared with victims who used other self-protective strategies….”[29]
&gt;* A 1997 survey of more than 18,000 prison inmates found that among those serving time for a violent crime, “30% of State offenders and 35% of Federal offenders carried a firearm when committing the crime.”[33]
&gt;* A 2013 study of more than 18,000 prison inmates found that in 2004, about “16% of state prison inmates and 18% of federal inmates” reported having a firearm during the commission of the crime for which they were incarcerated.[34]

* First, you're incorrect about being ""scantily dressed"" being a risk factor. There is evidence to suggest that, actually, dressing modestly tends to result in greater victimization, as you're more likely to be perceived as unwilling to fight back. At best the evidence is unclear, so giving this advice is bad because your ""common sense"" doesn't have any meaning in the real world.",Milskidasith,dxl6es6_1,1524083215,51,,11
19686,dxl6es6,"* Second, people don't complain nearly as much when you just give generic advice like ""stay in groups"" or whatever. The issue is that when you respond to a *specific* victim by telling them what went wrong, you are not providing support; you are simply focusing on how they are to blame and shifting the topic of discussion away from the crime that was committed. Very few people will call you out for saying ""it's safer to go out with friends, stay in pairs, and to watch your drink or prepare them yourself."" Many people will call you out for telling *somebody who was just raped* that they should have done all those things instead.",Milskidasith,dxl6es6_2,1524083215,51,,11
19686,dxl6es6,"* Third, and kind of related to your inaccurate point about dressing skimpily, discussions about how women were ""asking for it"" or did things that made them more likely to be victims do not happen in a vacuum. They happen in a system where rape and sexual assault are extremely hard to prosecute, and arguments about how a woman was dressed or her prior sexual history can and are used to condition a jury against believing her. Reinforcing the idea that women shouldn't dress a certain way if they don't want to be assaulted *also* reinforces the idea that women who dress that way *can't* be assaulted, or at least can't be trusted beyond a reasonable doubt.",Milskidasith,dxl6es6_3,1524083215,51,,11
19686,dxl6es6,"* On the other end of the coin, it also reinforces the idea that ""you can never stop rape, there will always be rape"" that you see in these discussions. This is an argument that basically says that you can't prevent some men from committing rape, but women *can* take actions to prevent themselves from being raped. The problem is that a lot of rape is caused by a lack of understanding of consent or the above misconceptions about how certain behaviors are ""asking for it"", and when you focus on the idea of Rapists who Can't Ever Change who target skimpily dressed women, you ignore the much larger and more solvable problem of dudes who don't understand what ""no"" means or what situations can be called consensual.",Milskidasith,dxl6es6_4,1524083215,51,,11

I just don’t think that “demonstrably ethically immaculate” is a great standard for this. It’s impossible to demonstrate someone’s “ethically immaculate”; the best you can do is show no marks on their record, so to speak. You’re essentially asking to prove a negative - prove he’s never done anything morally suspect - when you use that standard.

Wikipedia isn't the best source for what the mission of the US Army is, when it is [easily found on their official website](https://www.army.mil/info/organization/):",GTFErinyes,dn9mqvj_1,1505925398,1236,dn9mqdq,32
30925,dn9mqdq,"&gt;The U.S. Army’s mission is to fight and win our Nation’s wars by providing prompt, sustained land dominance across the full range of military operations and spectrum of conflict in support of combatant commanders. We do this by:
&gt;* Executing Title 10 and Title 32 United States Code directives, to include organizing, equipping, and training forces for the conduct of prompt and sustained combat operations on land.
&gt;* Accomplishing missions assigned by the President, Secretary of Defense and combatant commanders, and Transforming for the future.
It wants to fight and win wars. It has to be able to do so promptly (meaning, enough forces ready/active), have sustained (meaning it has the numbers and logistics to actually carry out operations for more than a day or two) land dominance (self explanatory), across the full range of operations and capabilities (meaning it isn't focused solely on one or a couple things, like the Germans being focused solely on tanks, or the Brits during the Cold War being primarily solely on anti-submarine naval warfare).",GTFErinyes,dn9mqvj_2,1505925398,1236,dn9mqdq,32

You have a fleet stationed out of Japan that is specifically focused on being ready for North Korea. You have US Navy ships in the South China Sea making sure China and its neighbors don't get too hostile. You have our ships in the Straits of Malacca, one of the most important and busiest trading routes in the world. Go further west, and you have ships off Pakistan supporting operations in Afghanistan. You have ships in the Persian Gulf, deterring any attempts by Iran or any other country to close the Straits of Hormuz, a vital sea route for oil the world uses. Likewise, the Red Sea has a US presence to ensure access to the Suez Canal is kept. Anti-piracy operations in Somalia are on going still.

First, you're attracted to what you're attracted to.  If you're only attracted to black people or gay women or people with big belly buttons, that's what it is.  The problem is when you *categorically* dismiss anything not in that list, and that's when it becomes racist/transphobic/weightist/whatever.  I think it's wrong to categorically state that people with such-and-such characteristics are not dateable, but it's perfectly fine to simply never be interested in that same set of people.  Basically, if I don't find you attractive, it's not because there's something inferior or wrong about you; rather, I'm just not attracted.  ""Oh, sorry, I don't date people who are ____.""  Bad.

But it becomes a very odd and nearly impossible to prove statement when you say you don’t find any native people attractive at all. Because you haven’t met all native people, and we don’t all look or act the same. It’s generalizing to a degree that is unnecessarily discriminatory and limiting. If you met a person that was gorgeous to you, had an amazing personality, had the same values, was sexually compatible with you, and you *decided* to not date them based solely on their race, that *is* racism. It doesn’t mean you’re evil or horribly wrong or anything. It just means that your sexual preferences are being impacted by racism/discrimination.

It just means that she sees no out/she doesn't have the strength to pull away. This point occurs when Aziz asks her to go down on him on the sofa. At this point Aziz has completely disregarded the thought that perhaps she's not consenting to sex and he just feels like it's a matter of time and persuasion before she gives in. And his manner of persuasion is just performing/requesting sexual acts. At this point it is already a form of mild mental assault. Mild but assault nonetheless. Sure this case isn't as bad as some others where men literally physically assault women and downright rape them but assault also encompasses scenarios where an individual starts feeling unsafe and begins to feel an obligation to partake in sexual acts. It's putting someone in a mental space where their instincts to run are blocked and they feel like they have to do what they really don't want to.

In order to deceive someone you have to act with purpose to hide something. A trans woman isn't necessarily acting with purpose to hide the fact that she has a penis just because she's living her life as authentically as possible. So you see a pretty girl at the bar and start hitting on her, she hasn't with purpose hidden the fact that she has a penis. All she has done is go out for drinks.

I would argue that it's less oppressive than the niqab/hijab with Islam, however, because you can always avoid working there. You could find somewhere where high heels were not mandatory. Of course, workplace uniforms are traditionally quite oppressive in general, because any semblance of personality in clothing is to be squished out in favour of people looking as if they're working here. However, with Islam, you're raised from a very young age to believe that this is the only way a woman should be. High heels don't carry ideological religious weight.

There is pressure to put them on but I would suggest that it's a pressure that is competitive and jealous over and above being oppressive. I don't think we find it fair that a man should dictate his wife/gfs outfit, for example. I think men barely notice half of this alleged oppression in terms of clothing, because they don't perpetrate it. A man can wear a suit all year and nobody know. There was that newscaster who did.
