To a certain extent, indeed. This is the crux of the /r/SRS vs Reddit at Large movement. To what extent do we owe other people the right to not be offended at the expense of our own expression. I might counter to a close friend offended by something I said that, ""I don't like it when you put your personal negative connotations associated with language on my expression."" Obviously there's some kind of line to be drawn. It's unreasonable for me to shout ""nigger"" in Times Square and be self-righteous about people being offended. But what if I say a white lady practicing yoga is culturally appropriating from Asian culture? Being that ""gay"" as an insult so ubiquitous among self-identified not-homophobes, I think it's unreasonable for someone to assume that calling something ""gay"" is necessarily bigoted. It may make you uncomfortable. It may imply bigotry, just as me saying ""bitch"" might imply misogyny. If I stub my toe and shout ""bitch"" it's probably not very indicative of anything.

The allegations of warmongering are not at all baseless.

That was one of the most important reasons that Mohammad and his tribe (Muslim and non-Muslim) were expelled from Mecca. They were allowed to come back again, but their attitude remained unchanged.

You'll notice quite quickly that in the cultures that encourage pedophilia, sexual relationships do *not* have to be comprised of two equal partners - in fact more often than not, one partner has complete ownership, dominance, or power over the other. I sincerely doubt that that approach to relationships will permeate into western cultures anytime soon.",tylersunami,d24mrtd_2,1460762278,463,,7
3438,d24mrtd,"I would argue that homosexuality is not like pedophilia because they were/are taboo for *very* different reasons, despite on the surface seeming similar. People don't like homosexuality because two dicks touching is ""gross."" People aren't necessarily grossed out of pedophilia because prepubescent girls are ""gross"" (hey, there is even a subreddit and entire community dedicated to lusting over ""boyish/prepubescent"" shaped girls). Pedophilia is gross and wrong because of how it lends itself to abuse, because it implies dominance, ownership, and power over the child. Even if the child is consenting sexually, the adult *still* has the upper hand (intellectually, financially, etc) or power over the child which makes the relationship inherently unequal. That is, fundamentally, why most people think pedophilic, teacher-student, and employer-employee relationships are inappropriate. Pedophilia just pushes the boundaries completely. A child can in no way be equal to an adult, unlike in the aforementioned scenarios where equality in pay or intelligence is possible. Kids aren't equal to adults",tylersunami,d24mrtd_3,1460762278,463,,7

Your approach is basically to say, ""Well we have a prior probability based on observed data (poor kids have less academic support and lower scores), but since we can't know for certain whether any *particular* student fits this model, we might as well ignore it entirely."" Statisticians don't claim that ""There's no prior probability"" when they do this, which is what you're suggesting by saying that you're making no assumptions.

What I mean to say is that statistics is a very broad brush we're painting with. It tells us that some people have it harder than others, generally along racial lines.

Many other European countries are doing exactly this: implementing mandatory vaccinations. And in these countries there's almost no talk about evil government doing evil things with vaccines, and turning them against native populations. Question is why? Part of the answer is that people understand that there's more good from it, the chance is slim to none, and oversight will keep the purpose of vaccines in check.

It was also condescending and ignorant, and mostly incredibly arrogant You can accuse me of that as well but I'll also say this: when we discuss government abuse, making something mandatory or voluntary isn't going to prevent abuse in general. All the horrible experiments done on people have been done because the situation in the country allowed it to happen. Eugenics happened in the US but that's why there's such a thing called IRB today. I would even say that making something like vaccines mandatory would allow for more security and transparency in how it's implemented. And yes, using vaccines for dangerous purposes IS RIDICULOUS.

It's a lot easier to argue against that strawman position, than to admit that when you take more and more power out of the hands of individuals and concentrate it in buraucracy and government, that concentrated power becomes a hot target for abuse by various interests with conflicting end goals in mind, most of which are contrary to the needs and goals of the individuals who are now subject to that concentrated power.",uraijit,dk7wrd4_1,1500051351,1,dk7v063,26

18478,dvbghy7,"So I'm going to address your view that elections in the US are unfair for conservatives. By this I'm automatically making the assumption that you believe these elections are biased in favor of democrats. Incidentally, I've heard arguments stating the opposite. For example, Jonathan Haidt, a moral psychologist who theorizes that morality is comprised of six ""foundations"", argues that conservative politicians are better equipped to recruit voters and party loyalists than are liberal politicians. He reasons that, on average, conservatives rely on all six foundations equally in making moral judgments, while liberals typically favor only three foundations (care, liberty, and fairness) and are often indifferent to the other three (sanctity, loyalty, and authority). In this way, conservative politicians can appeal to moderates more than liberal politicians can. Haidt uses this to explain why John Kerry lost to GW Bush during the 2002 election cycle.",Purple-Brain,dvbghy7_1,1520427519,2,,38
18478,dvbghy7,"Now I was making the assumption that an election is positively biased toward democrats if democrats have an easier time winning elections than do conservatives, which is how I interpreted your original view. However, maybe I'm misinterpreting and your view is instead that conservatives are treated unfairly by members of society (you cite the media and hollywood as examples). Well, for one thing, and as someone who comes from a conservative family, I can tell you firsthand that people who actively identify as conservative tend not to pay attention to news outlets like the New York Times, the Guardian, and the other news sources that you see appearing on r/news. Reddit is a very liberal website and if all you did was use Reddit, you may wonder why the entire Internet seems to hate conservatives. But I can assure you that if you only looked at my grandfather's newsfeed, you'd wonder why the Internet seems to hate liberals. Sure, there are fewer news outlets that are conservative, but this is partially because these news stations are often based in New York or other big cities, and big cities in America tend to be largely populated by democrats. Fox News is also based in New York, and not all of its employees are conservative. Either way, as long as Fox News is around, conservatives don't really need to watch any other news stations, and so they aren't really troubled by what left-wing stations like CNN are saying about them.",Purple-Brain,dvbghy7_2,1520427519,2,,38
18478,dvbghy7,"The reason why people in Hollywood are often left-wing is because Hollywood is located near the big city of Los Angeles, which is in California. Hence, it is pretty much the epitome of liberal. Those who don't want to deal with this simply don't go on to work in Hollywood. But I think it's only really a problem for people who are staunch social conservatives, because liberal celebrities are only really vocal about social issues (e.g. sexual assault, homophobia, racism, etc.), and so the only people who are really called out by these people are those who say things that are racist, sexist, and/or homophobic. And in my experience, very few conservatives actually say racist, sexist, or homophobic things. But while you could make a case that most racist, sexist, and homophobic people are conservative during this election cycle (this assumption only stems from the fact that they ostensibly voted for a president who demonstrates these qualities himself instead of the other candidate who didn't demonstrate those qualities), this doesn't mean that most conservatives are racist, sexist, or homophobic.",Purple-Brain,dvbghy7_3,1520427519,2,,38
18478,dvbghy7,"To that end, I would say that Hollywood is biased against people who are anti-progressive and/or bigoted, not necessarily people who are conservative. For example, it is perfectly acceptable to peacefully opposite abortion in this country.
Finally, while social conservatism and social liberalism are both split about 50-50 in this country in terms of who supports what, conservatives undeniably have an advantage in economic issues, as America is predominantly fiscally conservative. I'd also imagine that in any economic circles or on websites dedicated to finance and the economy, you'd find a lot more conservatives than you would on websites that are more focused on social issues. Outside of liberal circles (e.g. undergraduate programs in liberal universities), socialists and communists have pretty much just as bad of a reputation as racists and bigots do in this country.",Purple-Brain,dvbghy7_4,1520427519,2,,38

The former directly addresses the point and the latter is relevant because economic issues contribute just as much to electoral outcomes as social issues do, but the OP only mentioned social stigmas against conservatives and didn't address how they fare on economic issues. Many people vote based on their economic views rather than their social views so I figured it was relevant to point out how conservatives/right-wingers have an advantage here.",Purple-Brain,dvbuadm_2,1520442142,1,dvbtsmy,38

I would argue that liberal ideology, while not the most predominant ideology in actuality, is still the 'mainstream ideology' in the culture.

* Hollywood
* Late night talk shows
* Celebrities
* Sports figures
* All mainstream media (other than Fox)
* 90% of media in general (other than Fox/Breitbart/WSJ/a couple smaller publications compared to CNN/MSNBC/ABC/NBC/MSNBC/NYT/WaPo/Buzzfeed/Slate/etc)",allinallitsjusta,dvbur0q_1,1520442558,1,dvbuadm,38

As a conservative you have to go out of your way to find conservative entertainment/news/etc. America is still a center, center-right country on average, but if you just looked at mainstream culture you would believe 90% of the population is far left. This is why conservatives seem to do better than predicted in elections because they are completely drowned out of popular culture.",allinallitsjusta,dvbur0q_2,1520442558,1,dvbuadm,38
18484,dvbghy7,"Yeah, I agree, it definitely is the mainstream ideology in American culture.
To add on to your point, the culture is oriented towards/created by high school/college-aged kids and the majority of voters are older. I think this contributes to high conservative voter turnout a lot more than we think it does.
Also the fact that conservatives don't really care how much of media is liberal. They'll just ignore it and read what they like. If anything, it gives them more fuel to hate the media, and I can't really blame them tbh. And honestly, the stuff my conservative friends and family post on Facebook comes from websites I've never even heard of, so I think there's more out there than we think. But even if Fox News was the only possible way to get conservative news, I don't think it'd matter much.

22517,e2lbuni,"I think that you'll find that calling them racists is actually a pretty solid counter-argument, if only because it is the most likely scenario. That said, let's go through this so that I can explain *why* I think that way.
First and foremost, the science.
Rushton-Jenson (typically more Rushton than Jensen for the purposes of what I know), has been hammered over and over, decade after decade for his race realist arguments. [Weizmenn](http://philipperushton.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/iq-race-brain-size-r-k-theory-rushton-weizmann-canadian-psychology-1-1990.pdf) et al. 1990, was pretty scathing in its critique of Rushton's absolutely absurd idea that, well lets be blunt here, that human intelligence correlates inversely to dick size. That is, Rushton has actually made 'scientific' arguments that because black men have big dicks, they are evolutionarily stupider than white folk, while 'Mongoloids' (his word of course) are smarter by virtue of being a little lacking where they are packing.",AJECaros,e2lbuni_1,1531901716,21,,16
22517,e2lbuni,"That in and of itself should really tell you how fucking stupid the person you're dealing with is.
As another example, Rushton used the supposed brain size of 'american blacks', claiming it to be about 1267 cc's compared to the brain size of whites at 1357cc's. This leads to an IQ difference of about 15 points, and he presumes it would drop another 15 points on average (putting it in line with some tests conducted there) because those black people wouldn't have cross-bred with white folks and had their intelligence raised as a result.",AJECaros,e2lbuni_2,1531901716,21,,16
22517,e2lbuni,"These are actual things your source believes we should take seriously.
Both Rushton and Jensen frequently associated with white supremacist organizations, Such as Jensen's stint writing for an unabashed Neo-Nazi publication. They both opposed segregation (for some reason), and Jensen has such fun quotes like:
&gt;\[w\]here the differences in basic characteristics are not conspicuous, as in the case of Asians and whites, and when persons can fit in and do the same kinds of jobs and do them as well as anyone else, it may work. See, there are blacks who fit in this way too — who do all right. But the black population in this country is in a sense burdened by the large number of persons who are at a level of \[intelligence\] that is no longer very relevant to a highly industrialized, technological society. Once you get below IQs of 80 or 75, which is the cut-off for mental retardation in the California School System, children are put into special classes. These persons are not really educable up to a level for which there’s any economic demand. The question is, what do you do about them? They have higher birth-rates than the other end of the distribution. … \[T\]he best thing the black community could do would be to limit the birth-rate among the least able members, which is of course a eugenic proposal.”

Those things can have an impact on the genetics of a population. Genetics are a result of survival of the fittest, and in places where there is constant war, famine, low natural resources, the terrain and climate, and so on, will determine what strategies are most successful. If you throw in someone who has a high IQ and is high in openness and conscientiousness in a situation where long term investment strategies don't pay off, they're going to have hard time competing with those who take while the taking is good. Thus in places where immediate gratification seeking ensures survival, those genes will pass on to the next generation and it will get more intense as time goes on. This is why ""liberating"" countries from dictators never works, the problem isn't the dictator, it's the population.

It's actually very tragic and there's not a whole lot we can really do about it because even if we were to say bring them into modern Human Society we simply be taken care of them and their offspring would have similar IQs, although over the course of a few Generations we might be able to essentially breed (when I say breed here I mean put them in a system where a high IQs means success and therefore offspring) them back up to reasonable levels of IQ, their genetic line is essentially damaged Beyond reasonable repair. Thankfully not all the countries in Africa are like this, but it is depressing to see because I'm not a big fan of this and it's taken me quite a while to really accept it given that I'm a Libertarian who believes that meritocracy is the best system of market. At the end of the day it's like looking at an abused child, you can't really do anything for them, they're kind of doomed to be dysfunctional in some way, the only thing that you can really do is try to make their lives as functional is possible. This is actually one of the reasons why I'm so against totalitarianism, whether it's Socialism or fascism, and if it's not a main contributor, it's at least a huge factor in producing these outcomes, however much environmental factors might have on producing such a system.",GingerJack76,e4g75uc_2,1534657087,1,e4fwk3a,39

Unfortunately I'm going to have to use Apes as an example of comparison, I know that it's kind of considered racist, and for good reason because there really isn't a comparison because even with people with an IQ of 60 they're going to have societies much more advanced than bonobos or chimpanzees or any of our other closer cousins.

Education doesn't affect your IQ, at least not to my knowledge. And just having good nutrition and not being diseased doesn't mean that your IQ will raise because of it. It's more like that you have a genetic Baseline and if you don't get enough nutrition it decreases over time. Unfortunately they are right, some races have different IQs than others, and it is genetic, but the thing that they're wrong is that there are individuals that we need in society who have lower IQs because they don't get distracted with complex ideas, are less likely to be indoctrinated, and are more rigid in personality.

IQ has been studying for the last hundred years, it has been absolutely unshakable as a measurement for intelligence, recently people have been trying to redefine intelligence because it's inconvenient for their arguments to have it be labeled as such, but that's all it is, word games.

Narcissistic personalities, for the context of this example we're not going to talk about the actual narcissistic personality or any other kind of cluster personality disorder but rather personality quirks within people that might make them seem narcissistic on the outside, might be due to the fact that the person is disagreeable. Being disagreeable in the big five model means that they're more willing to criticize others, and they're just generally not willing to work with other people or don't really seem interested in interacting with others in a more positive relationship with them. It might also be because they're very judgemental, and that's a conscientiousness sub trait, and if you combine these two you might have something kind of close to a person who might seem narcissistic, but it's not like they have a disorder, it's more that they're just more judgemental and aggressive than your typical person. I'm obviously if you give them a killer intellect then they're going to have a very high opinion of themselves, they're not going to have a high opinion of anybody else, and although they're willing to engage in new ideas, such as learning a new skill or experiencing something new, they're still going to do other people who are not as smart as them or as quick as them as being not inferior but dismissible in their ideas.",GingerJack76,e4hjidd_3,1534719863,1,e4hegwz,39

Well this is actually a problem with people who are high in openness in general, it's not a narcissistic personality disorder, it's more like they get stuck in a logical Loop because they've accepted an idea that has presuppositions that won't allow other ideas to come in. This is actually why a lot of people who are highly open get attracted to things like Cults and things that are Colts like because they accept the ideas and accepting the ideas can lead you to forming views of the world that might shut you out from other ideas. At least that's how I think it works, we don't really know why this happens we just know that it kind of does. A lot of Arthur deikman's work has kind of influence my opinion on this, but based on my own experience and from what literature I've read on indoctrination Cults and seems to be in line with a lot of what has been reported. Although it's not like we have large-scale studies to show that this is true.

This is more question for a professor of psychology rather than a student. I wouldn't really know how to answer it without taking guesses at why this happens because I haven't seen any explanation as to why this happens, I've just seen that this happens. If I had to take a guess it would be that the person who is open to experience takes in the new idea and pushes out any old ideas that don't fit within the worldview that they have so they're more willing to accept new ideas but they're also willing to throw it away if it doesn't fit properly. Which is why it can be kind of difficult to deprogram somebody who's been indoctrinated because essentially what's happened is that they've taken in new presuppositions that reject all other presuppositions and then they take in new ideas but then reject them out right because they don't fit with the world you that they have.

That's not really true either, it does it's just not a direct predictor of creativity. Because it highly correlates with openness, and because openness has a marker of lateral thinking, basically jumping between ideas and forming new connections between those ideas, you get creativity through that. It's not like creativity is an unknown, it's just the ability to link ideas together into unique formations. So like somebody who's particularly creative will think of one idea and that will remind them of another idea and that will remind them of another idea, and you'll get this string of argumentation that they've produced on their own based on the information that they had. And this is why the creativity dimension of personality is under the concept of openness because that's just where the abilities come from, if you're high in openness you're going to be more creative than people who are lower in openness.",GingerJack76,e4hjidd_6,1534719863,1,e4hegwz,39

If the knowledge that they are trans is the blocker, that's transphobic. It isn't that there are certain traits associated with transgender people that you find unattractive, it's that you can't get over the fact that the person was born a different gender despite the fact that only a laboratory could tell the difference.

In this scenario, ""trans"" is not a term that refers to a set of attributes like ""man"" or ""woman"" was in the previous paragraph. It only refers to the state of being transgender/transsexual, with no other connotation (because of the hypothetical advancements in transition treatments).

There are [many different theories](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/belief/) about the nature of propositional belief, and going into them here would only be tiresome. Many of those theories allow for degrees of credence. On these theories, one could believe that Jesus existed without having a credence of 1 in the proposition that he did, thus allowing for the possibility that the story was fabricated. Furthermore, [the existence of Jesus is compatible with the gospels being fabrications.](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Jesus-Hoax-Pauls-Fooled-Thousand/dp/197432964X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1539795646&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=skrbina+jesus)",Gunnar_Grautnes,e7y79a0_3,1539800391,4,e7y0qfq,11

Some of these seem like common sense when you're sitting behind a computer, but if you look at violent crime, victims more often than not failed at one of the three principles.",Arthur_Edens,d6djyzr_1,1470939709,10,d6ddd03,20

Harris' take, simplified is: People in general have the wrong idea when it comes to self defense. They tend to either just not want to think about the reality of human violence, or they want to go in guns blazing (the counterpart to this in schools are teachers who think kids should never fight and both should be punished if they do, or rambo parents who tell their kids to punch bullies in the face so they'll leave you alone).",Arthur_Edens,d6djyzr_2,1470939709,10,d6ddd03,20

Nonbinary is a little harder to explain, but with transgenderism, could you not consider it as being something that is, as in they are just the gender they say they are. You don't say you feel like a woman, you are one.

1. We should tread _very lightly_ on matters of government controlling medical decisions.  While you might disagree with the pediatric guidance that says that it's little bit better to be circumsized from a health perspective (but not enough that they make it a suggestion), but do you want the _government_ to be the arbiter in this situation?

I disagree. I think talking about how fat I am in terms of mass makes more intuitive sense than how much force I am exerting.

40685,duw32oe,"1) there was no sign posted stating no firearms, nobody asked me to leave, and the area was not restricted by state or federal law
2) everyone the knows me best feels a whole lot safer knowing that I could be carrying when we go out. The “checkpoint” was a minimum wage 20 year old it wasn’t that hard honestly and nobody else even had to know I had it.",dooddog12,duwwrid_1,1519751627,-17,duwwbxi,22
