99,cutfbcs,"Eh, there's plenty of other reasons someone could be against immigration. I'll try give a few:
**1) You might believe that the short-term economic burden is too great**
This point is probably the best one. Even if we all agreed that increasing immigration was good economic policy in the long term, no one argues that it is a good policy in the short term without certain circumstances. Unless those circumstances are met, it's entirely reasonable for some people to criticise the level of immigration, particularly unskilled immigration, into a country. An obvious example would be if a country had a serious unemployment problem, and a generous system of unemployment benefits. In the short term, too much immigration could easily send the country into a massive budget deficit, which is going to have long-term effects.",[deleted],cutfbcs_1,1441633850,147,,20
99,cutfbcs,"**2) You might have legitimate concerns about social cohesion that aren't racist in nature**
Almost everyone, if not everyone, agrees that tolerance can only extend so far (i.e. the idea of 'reasonable tolerance') before a society fails to function coherently. Modern, Western ideas about tolerance were formed after the Reformation, during the Wars of Religion, and this political climate has informed thought about the subject ever since: for the first time, European nations had to deal with minority groups that were unprecedentedly large and powerful. This eventually led to a great increase in the general level of religious freedom in Europe, but it initially completely destabilised the region and caused a great deal of death and suffering. Of course this is an overly dramatic example, but there's no reason to think that a large increase in membership to a certain minority group that is not well accepted couldn't create similar friction again, and to a lesser extent it does in many countries. Much like my first point, this is really a criticism of the rate of immigration in certain circumstances.",[deleted],cutfbcs_2,1441633850,147,,20
99,cutfbcs,"**3) It isn't in your personal best interest from an economic perspective**
If you yourself are an unskilled worker, supporting unskilled immigration is only going to increase the competition for your labour, and end up driving your wages down. This seems like a reasonable position.

My argument is that if you want to limit the citizenship of people you disagree with then you shouldn't be just against immigration but also want to limit the birth of people you could potentially disagree with in your own country.

&gt;
&gt; So it's clear that at least 2/3 of gun homicides are mental health issues; if the suicidal person had proper mental health treatment, they likely would have been able to overcome their suicidal thoughts/tendencies.
When a person commits suicide he does so because he sees it as a solution to his problems. For example, if he has a lot of debt that he doesn't know how to repay, his creditors won't be able to hound if he is dead. Or if he wants sex but no woman will touch him, then he may prefer death to living alone.",alanforr,cw50tk0_1,1445252039,5,,18

2592,d0cep3j,"&gt;  manslaughter criminalizes the consequences of an individual’s actions rather than the actions themselves.
This isn't exactly true, because the legal standard for determining manslaughter is not simply ""Did the person die?""  The evidence used to prove manslaughter will be used to prove your actions warrant manslaughter.",orygunmane,d0cep3j_1,1456347457,3,,10
2592,d0cep3j,"&gt; If two different people are who are equally inebriated both decide to make a 12 mile drive at rush hour in New York, but one hits and kills a pedestrian and the other is stopped by the police, they face very different consequences.
Yes.  And so did the victims.  In a DUI case, the victim is society at-large.  The consequence they faces was having a drunk driver on the road.  If the driver kills someone, the victim is 1) society, for having a drunk driver on the road, and 2) the person who was hit by the car and died.  By your logic, the consequences for the driver should be the same in each case because their ""actions"" were the same.  However, **this line of thinking requires you to admit that hitting the person in the street was not an action at all**, and merely a consequence of the act of driving drunk.  The manslaughter law is applied because there was an additional action taken (the action of hitting someone with a car).  So while there is a specific consequence required to charge someone with manslaughter (someone dies), that is not proof the crime occurred.   To prove the crime occurred, you must prove the ACTIONS of the defendant caused the death.",orygunmane,d0cep3j_2,1456347457,3,,10

However, for perhaps 2 out of 1,000, their one punch causes the death of the person punched.

In your example, you present the scenario as if the only difference between the 2 people who kill someone and the other 98 who don't is misfortune.

3032,d158p7o,"However, I have to wonder if it's misandry or if it's misogyny? For example, in the case of parental rights, women traditionally are expected to stay home and raise children while men are expected to work and make money for the family. So while they do negatively affect men and positively affect women, it comes ultimately from a place of misogyny and expectations for women, not distaste for men.",Montagnagrasso,d182zfl,1458582502,3,d158p7o,32
3033,d158p7o,"Perhaps you're right.

3034,d158p7o,"I'll go through and take each of the points you made as it pertains to the double edged sword that is gender roles:
1. A side effect of both men being seen as the stronger (and therefore more aggressive) sex, they tend to be seen as guilty, and for that matter *more* guilty more often than women, who are typically supposed to be more docile and innocent (think: couldn't hurt a fly).",Montagnagrasso,d18mol6_2,1458610788,5,d18k7ft,32
3034,d158p7o,"2. Piggybacking off of the first point, men are supposed to be more sexually oriented as well. Therefore, if we go off of that line of thinking, it would follow that we always want sex and therefore shouldn't be able to be raped. *And*, if we are raped, we are seen as weak and 'unmanly' whatever that means. Again, women are seen as a group that cannot rape, because they are supposed to be innocent.",Montagnagrasso,d18mol6_3,1458610788,5,d18k7ft,32
3034,d158p7o,"3. Same idea, ""men are stronger and women are weaker"" means that men will be seen as guilty if a man and a woman have a physical fight, even if the fight is even.
4. Again, same thing. I won't use a no-true-scotsman fallacy here and say that feminists who push for those things aren't feminists, however they certainly don't reflect the views of the entire feminist community (like myself).",Montagnagrasso,d18mol6_4,1458610788,5,d18k7ft,32
3034,d158p7o,"5. This one is just old ideologies in general. Circumcision obviously has been around for thousands of years. However, it is more rare in the case of males to have permanent genital mutilation (though this does occur, unfortunately). But yeah, in general circumcision was seen as cleaner or something, because people didn't learn about washing their dicks :P.",Montagnagrasso,d18mol6_5,1458610788,5,d18k7ft,32

Yes, this comes too late for many. But again, this goes back to the idea that women are supposed to rear children, and therefore they should have the final say in wether or not children are created.

3034,d158p7o,"12. I addressed this point, but I'll reiterate: Men historically aren't expected to be parents. They're expected to be the bread winners. To go back to mythology, Odysseus was absent for *more than 10 years* of his son's life, fighting a war, and literally having an affair (sexual creatures) for another year. His wife was expected to stay home and raise their child that entire time, *and* stay loyal to her husband even though the same was not expected of him.",Montagnagrasso,d18mol6_11,1458610788,5,d18k7ft,32

Hopefully you can sort of see where I'm coming from. My view is pretty much that a lot of things that hurt men now are only hurting us because we're slower at dissolving the gender roles that helped us than women are at dissolving the gender roles that hurt them, which is putting them ahead of us. For example, women can earn the money for their household now, but masculinity still dictates that we can't be good parents, leading to legal issues like parental rights.",Montagnagrasso,d18mol6_15,1458610788,5,d18k7ft,32

Point of clarification here: do you consider ""feminist"" opinions to be widely held? Because most 3rd wave feminist opinions aren't really that common. As an example, feminism would likely state that ""having sex with an unconscious person is rape."" But that didn't happen in the recent Stanford case as an example, his lawyers were able to (somewhat successfully) make the argument that she consented despite being unconscious.

It seems to have ingrained within the ""virtuous"" a sense that since Blacks were oppressed in the past, they are stuck there, and are somehow less capable than Germans, Greeks, Jews, Celts, Arabs, etc. of picking themselves back up. To suggest that Black communities continue to struggle because of past racism is to suggest that Blacks are somehow so much worse than these other groups who have all been enslaved and oppressed.

There's loads of information available online but there's three big challenges: not all of it is credible (and it's difficult to tell what is without an education), many (or most) people aren't capable of actually learning it on their own, and there's no good feedback mechanism to assess progress. The classical education model has a proven track record and works because it solves those problems. It relies on accessible, credible experts (who ideally also develop new knowledge in their fields), penalizes students for non-participation, and provides feedback to students so they can track their progress. Universities also provide access to real equipment for very important practical training that would be too expensive for novices to purchase alone and too dangerous to operate just off YouTube videos. Automation and Big Data also won't really help us probe more fundamental scientific mysteries that could have huge applied value in the very long term but require massive education and huge resources to be advanced. Automation will do a lot for industry and manufacturing and Big Data could do loads for social science and epidemiology but there are lots of important fields that won't see big gains. Medicine is a huge area where individuals are still important for practice and they each need a lot of education. Medical research probably won't make huge immediate gains from Big Data.

It wasn't until a man looked at me after a book signing, and said, ""I love what say about shame, I'm curious why you didn't mention men."" And I said, ""I don't study men."" And he said, ""That's convenient.""
&gt;And I said, ""Why?"" And he said, ""Because you say to reach out, tell our story, be vulnerable. But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters?"" I said, ""Yeah."" ""They'd rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down. When we reach out and be vulnerable, we get the shit beat out of us. And don't tell me it's from the guys and the coaches and the dads. Because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else.""
&gt;""So I started interviewing men and asking questions. And what I learned is this: You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear, I'll show you a woman who's done incredible work.""
&gt;""Men are smart. They hear us asking for their vulnerability, but are also very aware that we may act scared or resentful when they show their vulnerable side. You wouldn't believe how often men tell me, ""I pretend to be vulnerable, but I keep in under control,"" or ""I give her enough to believe I'm being open because if I were totally truthful about how afraid or out of control I feel, she would judge me."" Underneath the pretending lies hurt, disappointment, and shame.""
&gt;Any everyone wonders why the male suicide rate is what it is? ""He never said anything..."" Yeah because when it comes down to it, no one really fucking cares, you are disposable.

No. The activities of humans only make sense in the context of natural selection and strategic optimization, e.g., game theory of genes. This *includes* altruistic behaviour. Human behaviour as individuals and groups are driven by natural selection economics of maximizing survival and reproductive success.

By acquiring resources (food, weapons, shelter) and spending less time per day on just survival, we reduce caloric needs *and* we increase our ability to survive and reproduce, and are also chosen for such abilities via sexual selection.
This is all a given because those humans who have not had genetic instincts to acquire resources or get more while doing less have reproduced less often than those with genes *for* those instincts.",DashingLeech,czcr6m6_4,1453830385,306,,31

Capitalism is simply a version that exploits the economics of generating this kind of wealth by recognizing we can *invest* in it up front. That is, if I take some of my valuable time to learn from you how to get my bow-making from 4 hours down to 3 or 2 hours (like you), I will get that time back and more in all the saved time hours in manufacturing time. It costs me *immediate* time for the long-term benefit, i.e., the ultimate value comes at the cost of proximate value. That is a mathematical concept true of all systems at all times.

Suppose I ask 10 people to work 1 hour each for me and in return I'll do 2 hours of your job for each of you. I gain 10 but owe 20 hours. With those 10 hours I get all of you to build a device that saves each of you 2 hours of work. I use it to pay you back.",DashingLeech,czcr6m6_6,1453830385,306,,31

Doesn't matter what system we have, I can always do that. In the end, I end up living in luxury without doing any work at any step of the way, as long as I have the know-how to build such a machine (or organize trade economically as the above comparative advantage) and supposing I have no competition who can do the same. Once the competition starts up, and we apply the concept to all things we do, we've reinvented capitalism in any social structure.",DashingLeech,czcr6m6_7,1453830385,306,,31

I get the house, pool, food, etc., but everybody else only gives me 1 hour of their labour in exchange for saving them 2 hours of labour. They all get the same result with less work. (Technology is another way of increasing economic efficiency, again regardless of the economic system.) Some people can get extremely wealthy from this while others get marginally better off, or even worse off. This is in part because of the value of the efficiency generated by those people who get wealthy (it's my machine in the example, and my design), but also a result of the [Ultimatum Game embedded in the economics](http://adnausi.ca/post/4289048927). That is, those with the opportunity can take almost all of the wealth generated simply because the structure of the transaction. If I have an opportunity for $100 and it will cost you $5 of your time to do it, I can offer you $6 of the $100 and keep $94. You only gain $1, but your other option is $0 because you don't know how to get the $100; I'm the one with the contact willing to give $100 for it. So you do the work, profit $1, and I profit $96 for doing nothing. I'm paid because of my *position* in the transaction, not my added value to it. This form of Ultimatum Game exist for all wealth generated between the value of output minus the value of input. This could be the market value of goods sold minus market value of labour to produce it. Or it could be the hours saved by a product minus the hours it took to produce it.

That's what centralizing power *is*, whether wealth or setting rules and controlling police or armies to stop competitors or cheaters of your system.

For example, if we all recognize this as true, we can all agree to put a governance in place that represents the interests of the people, not the wealthy, and collectively gang up on anybody that tries to centralize their power and become a monopoly and exploitive. We can *collectively* agree how generated wealth will be split, thereby cutting off the Ultimatum Game. This would look like unions (as in the Ultimatum Game link above) to equalize the power, or government redistribution such as progressive taxation to help raise the floor for everybody else, such that people still have incentive to do these things to growth their personal wealth but it also helps raise everybody else so there is less struggle for survival, and it becomes easier and easier for people to get even healthier and wealthier (e.g., education, infrastructure, social safety nets, universal health care).",DashingLeech,czcr6m6_10,1453830385,306,,31

Capitalist principles can be exploited in any system with or without money. The problem is a universal mathematical truth, not the particular system. The best system is one that generates the most value for the most people while putting up the most roadblocks to these monopolistic and exploitative mathematics, but no system can every be perfect.

I personally started transitioning in 2015 with hormones and even had a surgery to reduce the size of my adam's apple, which wasn't covered by insurance and cost me ~$8000 CAD, which I had the luck to have my very supportive parents help me with. Still, even though I only paid for half of it myself and had the help of my father for the other half, that cost impacted me financially extremely strongly and I don't think I would have been able to ever afford it if I also had to pay for rent and things like that. I was 19 when I went through with this surgery and I hadn't even started university yet, and I don't think I can describe through words impactful enough how much that surgery relieved me, and how completely and hopelessly miserable I would have been if I had to wait a few years to be financially stable enough to pay for all of it myself.

I had to meet with two different psychologists to evaluate my current suffering regarding the genitals I had, both of them agreeing that they considered that not getting GRS would be dangerous to my well being. And the funny thing is that I had plenty of doubts about it and was seeking guidance with them to help me take that decision, because I was so far down into the suffering and discomfort that having a penis and scrotum and everything that it just felt *normal* at this point, that the constant suffering and low self-esteem every time I looked in the mirror was just part of life. And I had doubts until the morning of the surgery. And I cannot accurately say how completely and utterly relieved I felt the first time I saw the result. I had fears, I had anxiety about if the decision I made was the right one, but for the first time in my life, I didn't feel disgust or pain or anxiety when I looked at myself.

Morality is not necessarily an external force that categorizes action and intention between ""good"" and ""evil"". It's just a social and cultural understanding of proper vs. improper behavior. That typically exists within greater social constructs of existence and belief systems. But it doesn't have to. Even if you are a nihilist and believe that life is ultimately meaningless and it doesn't matter what you do, you still have preferences.

Then, this term got taken on to mean something else: The way people will speak up about something they couldn't possibly have knowledge of: The *subjective experience* of another group of people. For instance: ""Black people shouldn't be scared of the police.""

38576,dizdsk9,"I think a lot of the problems you have with egalitarians stem from the same sort of thinking that those who you are referring to used to come to their conclusions about feminism. Jon Stewart said it best: groups of people are not monoliths.
Many egalitarians view feminism as anti man, because a loud fringe of feminists feel that way. If you go to r/mensrights you will see a lot of links to charities that people are involved with. They do want to enact positive change, but their experiences and world view lead them to believe the highest priority problems are different than what feminists believe. Now, there is a lot of overlap between the groups you point out, just like there's a lot of overlap between antifa, blm, and feminism. Many people ascribe to all three of those groups but many don't, as well. So I guess what I'm saying is most of those people only see the caricature of feminism the same way your only seeing the caricature of men's rights and egalitarian movements. People who are more moderate in general will have spoken to enough feminists to realize that 95% are not anti men, so they don't see the need to distinguish themselves from it, just like with blm and alm. Imagine during one of those riots that blm was present you're a white, local shop owner that gets looted. Aren't you going to feel targeted and resentful of the group who you perceive did this to you? I think it's a similar mechanism you're contemplating regarding the anti feminist groups. Think about men who lost custody to their kids to a drugged out cheating mother, or parents whose sons have been statutorilly raped only to see the perp get a slap on the wrist, or the argument that we should believe all rape victims out right without giving the accused due process, i.e. mattress girl.

MLK did organized marches which were officially set up had detours placed around them so as to not impede emergency vehicles, and if an emergency vehicle had to pass through the march they let it pass. He protested in a non-violent manner, not tolerating the destruction of property or physical violence from those who protested with him. He willingly allowed himself to be arrested and gave no resistance when that occurred using his mistreatment as example of how things were wrong and to show that they needed to change. His non-violence and passivity was key to giving his movement legitimacy.",cdb03b,e48lpv6_1,1534348652,1,,6
42348,e48lpv6,"BLM does not do this. They have not arranged for safe marches and have impeded safety vehicles often. They actively destroy public property at their protests and often attack bystanders as well as the police. The resist and sometimes even flee when faced with arrest for their actions. Nothing that they are doing in action honors MLK. They are the ones that are destroying his legacy through their active violence as well as through rhetoric that does not promote equality but rather seeks to favor blacks for no reason other than their ethnicity. They do not believe in a word of the ""I have a dream Speech"" they do not seek a world where people are judged on the merits of their behavior.

42349,e48lpv6,"""Honest confessions to you, my Christian and Jewish brothers. First, I must confess that over the past few years I have been gravely disappointed with the white moderate. I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that the Negro's great stumbling block in his stride toward freedom is not the White Citizen's Counciler or the Ku Klux Klanner, but the white moderate, who is more devoted to ""order"" than to justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice; who constantly says: ""I agree with you in the goal you seek, but I cannot agree with your methods of direct action""; who paternalistically believes he can set the timetable for another man's freedom; who lives by a mythical concept of time and who constantly advises the Negro to wait for a ""more convenient season."" Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.",SetsunaFS,e48mno2_1,1534349445,0,e48lpv6,6
42349,e48lpv6,"I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that law and order exist for the purpose of establishing justice and that when they fail in this purpose they become the dangerously structured dams that block the flow of social progress. I had hoped that the white moderate would understand that the present tension in the South is a necessary phase of the transition from an obnoxious negative peace, in which the Negro passively accepted his unjust plight, to a substantive and positive peace, in which all men will respect the dignity and worth of human personality. Actually, we who engage in nonviolent direct action are not the creators of tension. We merely bring to the surface the hidden tension that is already alive. We bring it out in the open, where it can be seen and dealt with. Like a boil that can never be cured so long as it is covered up but must be opened with all its ugliness to the natural medicines of air and light, injustice must be exposed, with all the tension its exposure creates, to the light of human conscience and the air of national opinion before it can be cured.""",SetsunaFS,e48mno2_2,1534349445,0,e48lpv6,6

One can be respectful towards individuals who request the use of different pronouns in the day to day interactions. And still argue against the idea of them. Especially against them making their way into law, it's not just about protecting people's right to be disrespectful. Perhaps some people just don't want to see them legitimized in such a way.",GraveFable,e88h56n_1,1540216868,91,,7

42845,e88h56n,"My view is that I will gladly use whatever pronoun you want, so long as I’m made aware of your request. Otherwise, I will use the information you have provided, like your appearance or name to determine what gender you likely are and the right pronoun to use. This makes a lot of sense to me, because society has constructed ideas of gender, and if you are following those ideas, you are implying that you are that gender.",AntiFascist_Waffle,e88rkud_1,1540225896,25,e88h56n,7
42845,e88h56n,"In other words, the point of the concept of gender, societally speaking, is to put people into categories which make the basis of sexual orientation: generally attracted to the group women vs generally attracted to the group men. If you reject this view of gender, that’s fine, but all the people who accept this view of gender will not automatically realize this. Basically, you can make an exception to the rules, but you can’t argue for the rules to be changed, because everyone else supports the rules.",AntiFascist_Waffle,e88rkud_2,1540225896,25,e88h56n,7
42845,e88h56n,"So following this logic, there’s no point in asking most people what pronouns they use: that should be evident from their appearance. The people who do use pronouns that are different would ideally let others know that they don’t play by society’s rules. And lastly and most importantly, people are obligated to respect this and use the right pronouns. Doing so is not that hard, and it’s the base tolerance  we enshrine: I don’t have to agree with you being a Christian or a Jew or a Pastafarian, but I do have to respect your right to be one.",AntiFascist_Waffle,e88rkud_3,1540225896,25,e88h56n,7
