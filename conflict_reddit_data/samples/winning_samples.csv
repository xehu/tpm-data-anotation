0,42_B,"I can't remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. 

He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.

However, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made.

------------------------------------------------------------
Right. So let me preface this by saying that any argument which touches on what is or is not moral will always fail, since humankind has not yet reached a consensus on what morality is, and whether it exists at all.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_1,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Your argument as stated can be divided into into two parts, which I will address independently. They are:
1. Animals deserve the same rights as a human, and
2. It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse, provided that this can be done without imposing violence
Let's start with your first postulate. *Animals deserve the same rights as humans*. That's a tricky one. I'll ignore the word ""deserves"", since it is impossible to logically prove or disprove. All available empirical evidence suggests that we live in a universe devoid of intentionality, and thus any condition imposed by the outside world can never be said to be objectively deserved or undeserved.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_2,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"But behavior imposed by societies, which are run by people and thus operate under intentional rules, CAN be said to be deserved or undeserved -- to argue otherwise would be to deny that morality exists at all. So, perhaps a better phrasing of this postulate would be ""It is moral to treat an animal's life with the same care as we would treat a human's life, and offer the animal the same protections we would expect for ourselves."" With your indulgence, I'll continue this discussion with that revised version of your initial statement in mind, just to avoid a lot of pointless debate.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_3,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"The first counterpoint that occurs to me is this: if society must treat an animal's life, and *quality* of life, with the same importance as we place upon protecting our own, then we must realize that we are not the worst criminals guilty of mistreating these creatures. Nature itself is brutal. Animals operating in the wild deal with constant scarcity, hunger, harsh conditions, and the never-ending threat of being stalked, hunted, and subjected to a painful death -- simply as a matter of routine living. Animals hunt and slaughter other animals all the time, often viciously, and utterly without remorse. ([source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ownANj8dKcQ)) And since we cannot solve this problem in any practical way, short of domesticating the entire planet, we are already doomed to fail at our task. As shepherds tasked with protecting the quality of life of our animal friends, we are hopelessly incapable.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_4,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"We of course do not expect animals to stop these behaviors, as we recognize that these are merely survival behaviors, and we accept that certain immoral behaviors can be deemed moral under life-threatening circumstances. For example, it is commonly cited that a starving child can hardly be considered a criminal for stealing a loaf of bread. Protecting life, and quality of life, can thus be considered a higher calling of morality, and taking certain actions may be justifiable when viewed in this light.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_5,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"We also do not expect animals to stop hunting and killing one another, because we don't expect them to know that they are *supposed* to. Animals have no concept of the notion of moral behavior (or, if they do, we are even less able to agree upon what their concept of morality might be than we are able to agree upon one of our own).",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_6,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Thus, the *only* creatures who can say with any level of certainty *what* would be moral treatment of an animal would be a human being. We can define this treatment any number of ways -- guaranteed access to sanitary living conditions, protection from physical harm, plentiful access to the exercise and socialization they might be accustomed to in their natural surroundings, etc -- *but* we cannot escape from the fact that it is *human beings* who are deciding that these behaviors are to be deemed moral and ethical. And since *we* have this capability, and animals evidently do *not*, we cannot call an animal equal to a human being. If we would not hold an animal accountable for the same actions we *would* hold a person accountable for, equality cannot exist.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_7,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Thus, the notion of inter-special equal rights is undermined as a fallacious concept, *even before* we consider what the rights guaranteed should or should not be. If we claim ourselves to be external judges of morality, and attempt to impose our moral judgments upon the animal kingdom, then we have promoted ourselves to the role of managers and overseers *from the very beginning*. The idea of approaching the problem from a position of equality is impossible.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_8,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"And if you accept my premise that humans and animals are fundamentally unequal in this way, then we have violated your premise that equal treatment is justified. We cannot treat the number three the same way we would treat the number four. Three and four are different. Humans and animals are different.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_9,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Now, if we accept my revised version of your argument, we can partially avoid this fallacy. We are not asking the WORLD to treat the lives of animals with the same care that we in SOCIETY treat one another; rather we are asking *society itself* to extend the rights and protections *we* enjoy to the *animals we encounter*, merely through the course of our day-to-day civilized lives. Why should *that* not be considered moral?",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_10,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"If we read John Locke, we see that a society is a collective who have consented to live by a social contract. We agree to give up the law of the jungle, and with it, our agency as animals, *in exchange for* the protections of a state. **This is a crucial point**, because the social contract as it currently exists is, *by design*, transactional. **We give up one thing in exchange for the other**.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_11,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Animals do not participate in this social contract. As we have stated previously, *they do not give up their wild agency, and we do not expect them to*. Why then is it the responsibility of society to still uphold the social contract?
Now would be a good time to touch on your second postulate. *It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse, provided that this can be done without imposing violence.* ""Imposing violence"" is asking someone to take a loss of some kind without just compensation. (This can be unjustly taking money, as in theft; or agency, as in slavery; or life itself, as in murder -- but *always* violence involves a one-sided transaction imposed by force.) If animals are fundamentally incapable of paying the entrance fee required by the social contract, we would be imposing violence upon the state to require it to extend freely its valuable rights and privileges. Taking without giving is *theft*.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_12,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Thus, the only rational way to discuss animal rights within the context of society is to make this a *civic* issue rather than a *moral* one. We can agree that it is in our civic best interests to treat animals with care and respect, because to do otherwise might tarnish or damage other precious pillars of our society. If we permit our citizens to behave as barbarians, we risk undermining the social contract in kind.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_13,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"*But* it is equally true that lax treatment of animals is highly profitable, and from a *purely civil* perspective (since, again, we have eliminated morality as a logically consistent justification), **profits enhance quality of life** across societies as a whole. If we argue that **the most moral way to govern is to govern in the best interests of the citizens**, tightening regulations on animal treatment would be the same as *denying our citizens those profits*, and thus imposing violence upon them. If protecting citizens from violence is more important than protecting non-citizens -- as is indeed the assumption fundamentally underlying our social contract, and with it the *entire incentive* for which we all opt-in -- then extending animal rights can only be viewed as civic immorality. A government's civic duty under the social contract is simply to protect citizens from violence and to promote gains in standard of living.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_14,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"Your second postulate is the following: ""It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse, **provided that this can be done without imposing violence**.""
And that's the bad news. It *isn't* possible to do this without imposing violence -- at least if we consider financial hardships, hunger, lost wages, and unemployment forms of violence. If promoting animal rights was *more* profitable than ignoring them, that would be moral from a civic standpoint. That isn't the world we live in.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_15,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"-----------------------------------
**SUMMARY:**
Humans and animals are not equal beings, and therefore the idea that they merit equal treatment is flawed. Animals can only receive moral treatment so long as there are humans to determine and agree upon what ""moral treatment"" means. If morality is a human construct, the idea that it should apply to animals is also flawed. Indeed, we can see every day that the wild world of nature is brutal and immoral by human standards.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_16,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36
42875,628_B,"If we use morality to apply only to human beings, and to guide our treatment of animals, we also encounter contradictions.

42875,628_B,"If we argue that animals do not merit equal standing with humans in our society, but that society should still treat animals with a specific and regulated level of care, we are harming the economy and imposing violence and poverty upon our citizens. Since no government can be called moral who would harm its own citizens, it would be impossible for a government to take those actions and still call itself legitimate.",glenndeann,t1_ck2dhsc_18,1409189721.0,2.0,t3_2eqf4w,36

I would agree that huge disagreement occurs on the definition of morality, however, the vast majority of us would agree that it 'exists', and that is is possible to be moral and immoral. In addition, the definition of morality changes over time and in different cultures. For example, 300 years ago, it would be unheard of for a white man to be against slavery of black men. It would be perfectly moral to hit your wife if she didn't make dinner on time. It would moral to give a homosexual the death penalty.

I would argue that we are. In nature, the animal is unlikely to suffer horrendously for more than a few days in the more extreme scenarios. Humans, however, not only abuse animals for their whole lives, they have bred trillions of animals specifically for that purpose. Counting up the total number of hours each animal has spent in pain or fear due to humans, we would end up with a much higher figure (a figure which is more than likely to be in the quadrillions) than that of the pain/fear caused by all other animals added together in the past century or so.",helpCMV,t1_ck2sme8_3,1409238938.0,1.0,t1_ck2dhsc,36

Animals have no concept of the notion of moral behavior (or, if they do, we are even less able to agree upon what their concept of morality might be than we are able to agree upon one of our own).

We can define this treatment any number of ways -- guaranteed access to sanitary living conditions, protection from physical harm, plentiful access to the exercise and socialization they might be accustomed to in their natural surroundings, etc -- but we cannot escape from the fact that it is human beings who are deciding that these behaviors are to be deemed moral and ethical. And since we have this capability, and animals evidently do not, we cannot call an animal equal to a human being. If we would not hold an animal accountable for the same actions we would hold a person accountable for, equality cannot exist.
No this is where I disagree with you. I would like to bring your attention to the idea that we are discussing someone with mental retardation rather than an animal. In most cases, a seriously mentally retarded person has a lot less intelligence than some of these animals, eg. dogs, cats, monkeys.

We are not promoting ourselves to the role of managers and overseers, because morality is a human concept (as far as we know) and the point of morality is not to do with animals.

You are right in a sense, but simply because they are different numbers, doesn't mean one should treat three any better than four. Three and four are different, but they are both used in mathematics.

42876,628_B,"&gt;Why should that not be considered moral?
I would say that being as moral as possible towards animal (if you accept that one **can** be moral towards animals) would involve not supporting the animal abuse and exploitation which occurs by not buying animal products. You wouldn't have to commit raids or whatever, and you would not be able to go **fully** vegan (car tires sometimes contain animal products) but you could go as vegan as possible.",helpCMV,t1_ck2sme8_11,1409238938.0,1.0,t1_ck2dhsc,36
42876,628_B,"&gt;If we read John Locke, we see that a society is a collective who have consented to live by a social contract. We agree to give up the law of the jungle, and with it, our agency as animals, in exchange for the protections of a state. This is a crucial point, because the social contract as it currently exists is, by design, transactional. We give up one thing in exchange for the other.
Surely that means we no longer must kill other animals for food, as in Western societies this is unnecessary?",helpCMV,t1_ck2sme8_12,1409238938.0,1.0,t1_ck2dhsc,36
42876,628_B,"&gt;Animals do not participate in this social contract. As we have stated previously, they do not give up their wild agency, and we do not expect them to. Why then is it the responsibility of society to still uphold the social contract?
If we give up the law of the jungle, surely that means we should stop interfering with the 'jungle' and leave animals to do what they want? Giving up the law of the jungle suggests you will not involve yourself with it and will not interfere. If I went out to live on a desert island close the UK (where I live now), just because I have 'given up the law of the land', or whatever phrase I would like to use, doesn't mean I can go back to England and start killing people.",helpCMV,t1_ck2sme8_13,1409238938.0,1.0,t1_ck2dhsc,36
42876,628_B,"&gt;Now would be a good time to touch on your second postulate. It is moral to liberate animals from places of abuse, provided that this can be done without imposing violence. ""Imposing violence"" is asking someone to take a loss of some kind without just compensation. (This can be unjustly taking money, as in theft; or agency, as in slavery; or life itself, as in murder -- but always violence involves a one-sided transaction imposed by force.) If animals are fundamentally incapable of paying the entrance fee required by the social contract, we would be imposing violence upon the state to require it to extend freely its valuable rights and privileges. Taking without giving is theft.
The definition of violence can also be to inflict an injury or death upon someone. It is not crystal clear for an absolute definition, but even if we use yours, what ever gave these factory famers/slaughterhouse owners/or whatever the right over these animal's lives? What gave them the right to remove them from the jungle? In effect, these people never owned the animals in the first place.",helpCMV,t1_ck2sme8_14,1409238938.0,1.0,t1_ck2dhsc,36
42876,628_B,"&gt;Thus, the only rational way to discuss animal rights within the context of society is to make this a civic issue rather than a moral one.
Even so, taking the example of meat, the land required for producing meat could instead have been used to provide food for several times more people than the meat provided for. In addition, it is not only cheaper to grow crops, it is also far better for the environment.",helpCMV,t1_ck2sme8_15,1409238938.0,1.0,t1_ck2dhsc,36

46498,679_B,"You hit a lot of points in your main statement and I don't really have the time to go paragraph by paragraph, disagreeing or agreeing.  But what I will tell you is that you're missing the bigger-picture:  *democracy*, not just the American populace, has the fundamental issue of ill-informity.
The intention of our system of government isn't necessarily about what is ""right or wrong.""  That's weird to type, and kind of weird to read, but when you choose to participate in a democracy, you participate in a system which you value the freedom of the individuals.  You give everyone an equal vote because we are assuming everyone is of equal value, as a person.  We are choosing to give everyone freedom, at the cost of maybe losing sight of what could be potentially ""right"" or ""wrong.""  I mean, what if we had a monarchy with a philosopher king, who perfectly knew economics, politics, government systems, international relationships, moral systems, philosophy, mathematics, science, etc, and who was perfectly just?  Would we need a democracy then, if he made all the laws, all the decisions, set all the precedents?  It's too bad an individual like that hasn't come about - we are too constrained by our biology, our emotions, our lack of time, our obligations.  But if there *were* such a person, why would we need democracy?  Let him do everything for us.  Oh, except now, there's a time constraint.

I think there are.  Education isn't a ""new"" thing, but the nature of the beast is ever-changing.  Now more than ever, more and more people are getting an education.  But there is only so much which can be beneficial to the political process.  Assuming a perfectly knowledgeable population with an equal distribution of all fields of academia, you're still only highlighting a minor percent of the population which could be constructive to the political process.  Economics, political science, law, philosophy.  A PhD in quantum physics or whatever is spectacular, but i'd be surprised if that person even had the toolkit to analyze the minimum wage properly.  I mean, i'm an economics major, I love economics, breath it, *but even I hardly have the toolkit to properly analyze the minimum wage.*  And so now we are at the crux of the issue:  remove the assumption that the population is perfectly knowledgeable.  Add in real-life constraints.  You ever had to scrub toilets for a living?  Serve tables?  Fix cars?  Clean pools?  40 hours a week, maybe more, or maybe you have to drive across town for your second job.  Maintain your family.  Make sure your lawn is up to standards.  Pay your bills.

You aren't fulfilled by anything, don't have the energy to do anything you used to love, and find that you don't really love anything anymore, anyway. You don't see the point in anything.

Dr. James Austin, a neurologist and professor at the University of Missouri, has described meditation as being able to ""[rewire the brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Brain)"".

The formal definition of art is that it contains at least one of the [five elements of art](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elements_of_art)
In reference to the blank canvas, you have to look at it as an installation; it's not a painting of nothing, it's more a sculpture involving a white canvas. In fact, the paragraph accompanying it is also part of this installation. Once you've accepted that, it's easy to see how the blank canvas meets the first definition. It utilizes texture (the canvas, being an intentional part of the installation, is a deliberate use of texture), space, shape (namely squares), and value.",kaminamina,t1_cfidj9k_1,1392740069.0,11.0,t3_1y8e6p,6

The fact that we can even have a conversation about whether or not the blank canvas is art means it's doing its job. It is meant to challenge your perception of what art is. A similar work would be [The Treachery of Images](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg) by René Magritte. (""Ceci n'est pas une pipe"" means ""This is not a pipe."") It presents a realistic portrayal of a pipe, but reminds you that it's *not* a pipe, it's just a *painting* of a pipe. So why is it that people consider *Treachery* to be art but the white canvas not to be art? Is it simply because the artist didn't paint anything? Because that's basically discounting a piece of art because it has less effort involved, which has proven time and time again to be a very poor way of thinking about things.

126117,1803_B,"Right. This answer may be a tad complex and I'm unsure if I can express it well, but bear with me.
In practice, whenever you make a statement about something, in reality you say two separate things. Firstly, you say that the thing you are saying is believed to be true; if you say ""on my left is a dog"" you indicate that you believe that there is a dog on your left. The same goes for subjective statements; ""that dog is annoying"" indicates that you believe that that dog is annoying. Hopefully, this is all self-evident.",Tomf1sh,t1_cehxooj_1,1388942395.0,459.0,t3_1ugfg7,8

Upon reflection, this makes perfect sense; why would you say something that you didn't think was worth saying? But this highlights that when you say something, you are not just an impartial dictator of truth; you are reflecting your beliefs *and claiming that you believe they are worth stating*. Calling someone fat doesn't just say ""I think you're fat""; it also, depending on context of course, can also say ""I think you're fat, and I am okay with saying that fact out loud in order to belittle you and therefore use your weakness to on some level establish social superiority"".",Tomf1sh,t1_cehxooj_2,1388942395.0,459.0,t3_1ugfg7,8

You write ""God, that person is terrible at singing""; they interpret it, and perhaps legitimately in some contexts, as ""He thinks that person is terrible at singing, and the fact that he said it indicates that he's trying to use that person as a way of looking superior; after all, why else would he bother?""",Tomf1sh,t1_cehxooj_3,1388942395.0,459.0,t3_1ugfg7,8

155977,2203_B,"I'm going to take a stab at this, I was in a teamster for a few years and definitely have some gripes with unions but also see their utility. Sorry for the wall of text.
Your first point isn't really an issue with unions specifically but with any large organization. According to wikipedia the AFL-CIO has over 11.5 million members, and the teamsters have over 1.3 million. Whenever you are dealing with organizations at that scale bureaucracy is somewhat inevitable.",manyrustyions,t1_cc1kppg_1,1378311399.0,4.0,t3_1lpmle,7
155977,2203_B,"I'll address points 2 &amp; 3 together as they are related. *In my view* and by most accounts I think labor unions have made huuuge strides in their 'fundamental' work as you put it. Let me give you an example. I mentioned that I was a teamster for a few years, I worked through graduate school **part time** (20-25 hrs/wk) 3rd shift. While my pay wasn't spectacular (~12.50/hr) it was unskilled, manual labor. On top of that I received tuition benefits (up to $3,000/yr), health insurance, dental &amp; vision, childcare benefits (I dont have kids), a week of paid vacation a year, and a few sick days. I want to reiterate again that this was part time, unskilled manual labor. During the same time I was employed part time by a large research hospital for research related to my field of study. My job at this hospital, doing graduate-level medical research gave me a whopping ($10/hr) and absolutely no benefits. The point of this is that union membership often comes with a lot of perks. That being said, the big trend right now (in the US) to limit/break/bust unions is not coming from the individual level of businesses but is coming from the policy level with initiatives like right-to-work. Strategists have figured out that the single best way to harm unions is to decrease/limit their membership. This causes a decrease in union dues, and a decrease in union power/influence which becomes a kind of downward spiral. The only way for the unions to fight back these initiatives is also at the policy level via lobbying. A union that doesn't do this is leaving itself vulnerable from the top.",manyrustyions,t1_cc1kppg_2,1378311399.0,4.0,t3_1lpmle,7
155977,2203_B,"And finally, your last point about insensitivity to business needs. While there is a decent amount of negativity (some rightly so) to union job perks, and how difficult it is to get fired from a union job, it has some serious advantages for for the business as well. From my limited understanding, a union contract is kind of like the business sub-contracting out its labor. So the company I worked for had very little to do with the workforce in terms of disciplinary action and the union was responsible for making sure everything got done. So if you skipped out on work one day, it was oftentimes union reps who you would have to answer to not company management. For the company I worked for, this had advantages in sense that there were maybe 10 non-union managers and ~50-75 union employees who in essence self-regulate themselves via union reps who were also workers. Now specifically to your point about 'large' unions, the thing about my former employer using this union was that if the shop was short-staffed for some reason, oftentimes other union workers from nearby locations (same employer, different location) would come in to fill in. That is certainly an advantage for the business.",manyrustyions,t1_cc1kppg_3,1378311399.0,4.0,t3_1lpmle,7

203523,2878_B,"You specifically asked about the suspicious stock trading.
There's an excellent summary of the information investigated by the SEC and FBI following 9/11, when they both looked into the suspicous trades, [here](http://www.911myths.com/index.php/Put_Options).  It's a long read so I'm going to pull out some of the highlights:
&gt;The AMR put trading on September 10 further reveals how trading that looks highly suspicious at first blush can prove innocuous. The put volume of AMR on September 10 was unusually high and actually exceeded the call volume by a ratio of 6:1—again, highly suspicious on its face. The SEC traced much of the surge in volume to a California investment advice newsletter, distributed by email and fax on Sunday, September 9, which advised its subscribers to purchase a particular type of AMR put options. The SEC interviewed 28 individuals who purchased these types of AMR puts on September 10, and found that 26 of them cited the newsletter as the reason for their transaction. Another 27 purchasers were listed as subscribers of the newsletter. The SEC interviewed the author of the newsletter, a U.S. citizen, who explained his investment strategy analysis, which had nothing to do with foreknowledge of 9/11. Other put option volume on September 10 was traced to similarly innocuous trades.
&gt;Another good example concerns a suspicious UAL put trade on September 7, 2001. A single trader bought more than one-third of the total puts purchased that day, establishing a position that proved very profitable after 9/11. Moreover, it turns out that the same trader had a short position in UAL calls—another strategy that would pay off if the price of UAL dropped. Investigation, however, identified the purchaser as a well-established New York hedge fund with $2 billion under management. Setting aside the unlikelihood of al Qaeda having a relationship with a major New York hedge fund, these trades looked facially suspicious. But further examination showed the fund also owned 29,000 shares of UAL stock at the time—all part of a complex, computer-driven trading strategy. As a result of these transactions, the fund actually lost $85,000 in value when the market reopened. Had the hedge fund wanted to profit from the attacks, it would not have retained the UAL shares.
&gt;The FBI investigated a trader who bought a substantial position in put options in AIG Insurance Co. shortly before 9/11. Viewed in isolation, the trade looked highly suspicious, especially when AIG stock plummeted after 9/11. The FBI found that the trade had been made by a fund manager to hedge a long position of 4.2 million shares in the AIG common stock. The fund manager owned a significant amount of AIG stock, but the fund had a very low tax basis in the stock (that is, it had been bought long ago and had appreciated significantly over time). Selling even some of it would have created a massive tax liability. Thus, the fund manager chose to hedge his position through a put option purchase. After 9/11, the fund profited substantially from its investment in puts. At the same time, however, it suffered a substantial loss on the common stock, and overall lost money as a result of the attacks.
When you just look at the fact that there were way more put options, it sounds very suspicious.  So that's all ""truthers"" mention.  When you go a little deeper, and look at each of the individual companies and individuals who made those trades, as the SEC did, you see that there's a reasonable, completely non-conspiracy reason those trades happened.  A conspiracy theorist will tell you ""well the SEC was in on it"".  And in isolation, maybe that could be true.  But they have to say that over and over, about a growing number of people, organizations, and groups.  When your list of conspirators grows to thousands and thousands of individuals, it doesn't make sense.",kinkykusco,t1_cqw2c9f_1,1430582900.0,83.0,t3_34m77r,4

&gt;Explain why we have the natural right to self defense, and how, logically, that right extends to include firearm ownership. Or the claim that gun rights derive from natural rights will remain entirely unsubstantiated.
In the link you provided it's pretty clear that the right to live is a natural right.

Here's an example of situation people have and could face. I'm hanging out in my house and someone (or a couple people) breaks in and they have a baseball bat(s) or some other deadly objects. If it is my right to live and therefore my right to self defense then I should have the best means of self defense available to me. Now, just to be clear, the best means in general isn't the best means in all situations, just that it's going to be better suited for a variety of situations.

243935,3474_A,"&gt;But If your thought is that the right to firearms is derived from the right to self defend would it not make more sense that the natural right to self defend justifies the legal right to live in a firearm free environment.
Here's the problem, if you take away firearms then there is no longer an equalizer for a whole variety of situations, just like the example I have presented. There is the potential that you will be in a situation where you are having to defend yourself from someone else that has a gun, but at least it would be a lot closer to a ""fair"" fight.

There's isn't any proof that this is a fact. Since the number of defensive gun uses is a very hard statistic to gather, it is unknown if guns save more live or cost more lives. One thing you have to consider is if you get rid of guns, that doesn't inherently mean that those lives wouldn't have been lost by other means. If you look at countries like England and Australia, the total number of murders and crime was unaffected by their gun control measures. If you actually look at the crime and murder rates in those countries, those statistics actually increased the first couple years after their gun bans. They did eventually start to decrease, but the US has also steadily decreased in the same periods.

Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. 

I would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.

EDIT: Thanks for your responses lads. As many of you pointed out, our argument depends more on the context of the use of the word and I think that my friend and I were arguing about the semantics and definition more than our intended meaning behind use of the word ""natural"".",seanyowens,t3_2ro9ux,,,ORIGINAL_POST,6
291636,4237_B,"&gt;1) The only way to stop the Joker is to kill him
Batman has more options than just killing the Joker. He could, for instance, kick him in the spine and leave him a paraplegic. Or amputate his limbs. Or call up one of the more mystical members of the justice league to put some kind of curse, enchantment or imprisonment spell on him. There is a wide gulf of stuff Batman could do between ""kill joker"" and ""leave Joker to the authorities"".",MisanthropeX,t1_cr7fgpo_1,1431493937.0,2.0,t3_35s5bb,6

Fair enough. That's one delta for you, my good sir. I hear by amend my argument by changing ""kill"" to ""permanently incapacitate"".",Hashi856,t1_cr7fxxr_1,1431494998.0,0.0,t1_cr7fgpo,6
