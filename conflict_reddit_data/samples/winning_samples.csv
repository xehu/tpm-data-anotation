0,61_B,"I can't remember the topic that spurred this discussion, but a friend and I were debating whether man-made things were natural. He took the position that they are unnatural. 

He cited this definition by Merriam-Webster:  existing in nature and not made or caused by people : coming from nature (http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/natural) as his basis for the distinction for natural vs. unnatural.

However, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural? It is only through natural occurrences that we have this ability, why is it that we would give the credit of these things solely to man, as opposed to nature? We are not separate from nature, thus, how can any of our actions or creations be unnatural? If we were somehow separate from nature, I would understand the distinction between natural and man-made. However, I think unnatural and man-made are not synonyms by any means. It seems to me that man-made things MUST be natural due to our being part of nature. 

I would love to hear your arguments and to have my view changed if I am mistaken in my logic somewhere along the line.

5988,61_B,"&gt;Cheaters cheat because of underlying issues with the relationship. My belief: if that's true, there are a lot of possibilities - not just breaking up - that could fix the problem, such as ... talking about the problem.
Yes. But ""talking about the problem"" is an ideal situation. It often doesn't work out so well that way.

This view seems to reflect a sort of carbon chauvinism.  Why should we expect aliens to have similar physiology, mental capacity, etc. as us?  Why should we expect other sentient life to experience the same problems that we might?  I think some of these assertions (corporate greed and government corruption in particular; I'm willing to accept conflict as something that's probably common in some capacity to most sentient life at this stage of development).",kotomine,t1_cmqmfx7_1,1418198705.0,6.0,t3_2ottrr,7

The sort of war that would wipe out humanity is a low-probability event from year to year (probably &lt;1% per year) and so if we are to imagine many possible forms of alien life, it seems likely at least one won't be wiped out by war.  Government corruption decreases in developed countries on average (or more precisely, the countries that spend the most of their GDP bribing government officials are lesser-developed countries).  Mass extinction events are few and far between.  Global warming may cost a few trillion dollars over a few centuries, and it might shift shorelines, but I'm doubtful that it's a really big existential risk.  A global warming-triggered mass extinction event would take place over a pretty long time scale (thousands of years or more; correct me if you have real estimates for this) while technology has been accelerating exponentially (yes, I know it can't do this forever, but even in 50 years we should be much closer to solving this problem).",kotomine,t1_cmqmfx7_2,1418198705.0,6.0,t3_2ottrr,7

We know that we cannot separate observation from reality. We know that math is particularly good at describing the universe. We know the insignificance of our position as a planet.

That's the nature of discrimination that people only associate a group with the most perceived negative attributes of that group.  This slowly begins to die as more and more people are coming out and more and more people are realizing that someone they respect and or love is gay.

55979,824_A,"Two things:
1. Is-ought problem. Just because someone is capable does not mean they should necessarily do anything.  Nothing requires a nation to police the world, no logical necessity.  Your argument is based on the intuition that most people would agree with such an idea, and I would counter that by saying it invalidates the whole idea of being a ""sovereign"" nation. Establishing a global police force, whether it is in fact ""good""/""positive"" (who gets to define those, anyway?) puts at risk anyone who is in the minority of opinion, any nation which does not have the physical strength to put up resistance. Basically, your idea of a global enforcer paves the way for whole cultures to be marginalized and made to fit others' conceptions of morality, which intuitively, is an unacceptable risk to one's national/personal autonomy.  It also prevents any new methods of thinking to be considered - do you really believe a nation, once put in that kind of a position of power over the world, would be willing to give it up? Who even gets to decide when the need for such a global police force has passed? How would such a change be enforced if, by your own thinking, the nation in charge is literally the most physically capable of enforcing policy?",Thomas-C,t1_cj8hvl7_1,1406402917.0,4.0,t3_2bsdbd,5
55979,824_A,"2.  Assuming sovereignty WAS considered in such an establishment, would a police force really be effective? How much compromising would have to be made to accommodate the myriad ways in which nations choose to govern themselves? How would you go about determining which cultural mores have more weight than others? For example, many consider religious belief to be outside the purview of governance - how would theocratic nations be subject to the law of such a police force? Would you cast aside particular beliefs in order to enforce policy? Again, as with my first point, how is such a standard even set?",Thomas-C,t1_cj8hvl7_2,1406402917.0,4.0,t3_2bsdbd,5
55979,824_A,"Seems to me that if there ever was such a thing as a global policy for governance, it could not be placed squarely in the hands of one nation (hence the UN). Such a move carries with it far too much of a risk that, should said nation disagree with any other, it would enforce its own beliefs and laws upon the rest of the world, and the rest of the world would not be in a position to change it.  A nationally independent governing body is at least a small step in a more practical way of implementing the idea of global governance - it is risky as well, for the same reasons, but is itself a better representation of your own reasoning, which is that a majority of the world's people could agree on a standard of law, simply because it allows more of the world to be involved in the creation of such law. Less sacrifice of autonomy with the same possibility of global governance. When faced with such a choice, my intuition tells me folks would prefer more autonomy over their decision making than less.",Thomas-C,t1_cj8hvl7_3,1406402917.0,4.0,t3_2bsdbd,5

There are many different ways of doing this, many different flavors, but they have all generally been met with great success. One example of this type of method is where a teacher presents a problem and leaves the students to work it out on their own. Use of the internet and other resources are encouraged, and maybe a hint is given. For example, a teacher might say, ""See that building over there? I want you to figure out how high it is. Here's a hint: google trigonometry. Prize for the first group who figures it out."" And then the students get to work, trying to figure out how this can be done. After a while, one of the students says, ""Hey teacher, it looks like we need something called a clinometer!"" ""Excelent!"" says the teacher. ""You're making great progress.

So Johnny likes rockets, and he spends a month playing Kerbal Space Program every day, and maybe building and launching rockets on his own.

The fundamental problem with your view is that it leaves no room for compassion or empathy, which is a trait that most people I've ever known value to some degree or another. Nor does it make any allowance for the fact that scientists do not yet fully understand consciousness in the healthy adult human brain, much less consciousness as it applies to an infant, a person in a coma who is still showing signs of brain activity, a person experiencing REM sleep, or an orca. In fact, there is a newish theory of consciousness making some waves called the integrated information theory of consciousness, which contends that consciousness is measurable and that any person, animal, or even computer program with a phi above zero has some level of consciousness. You don't have to buy into Dr. Tononi's theory to change your view, though. That the theory exists as just *one of many* competing models of consciousness should give you some pause in your own moral certainty about how much suffering an orca separated from its pod experiences, or whether an infant or profoundly mentally handicapped person experiences a level of consciousness that you would be uncomfortable sniffing out.",klw,t1_cgd5p1v_1,1395921798.0,11.0,t3_21hpd2,6
100360,1442_A,"Interestingly, I also tend to correlate the value of individual human, and to some extent, animal life to consciousness, but my bar is much, much lower than yours. For instance, I am not morally opposed to abortion, nor do I feel that keeping people with no brain activity on interminable life support is morally defensible. But I am much less confident in my ability to figuratively step into the shoes of a crow, an infant, or a person with Down's Syndrome and make judgments about how conscious they are. Nor am I closed to the idea that there are types of consciousness I cannot currently comprehend. I also believe that lives of animals, insects, and even bacteria have value separate from consciousness because life systems directly contribute to the health of the ecosystem upon which humans depend. This is why I am morally opposed to wanton, purposeless destruction of toads or naked mole rats or polar bears or what-have-you.",klw,t1_cgd5p1v_2,1395921798.0,11.0,t3_21hpd2,6

That doesn't validate the act of drunken driving, which is more likely to kill other drivers, pedestrians, bikers, etc. than sober driving. Similarly, to choose an extreme case, we restrict the ability of citizens to murder other citizens because we believe people have a right to live without being murdered.

There's a whole philosophical debate around the question of ""is it possible for someone else to act just like a person but to not be conscious"".  (The term for that is ""philosophical zombie"".)  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie
That being said, I think that it isn't that hard to rule that out as a possibility.  Our conscious mind, our experiences, isn't just a random artifact; it's a basic function of how our brains work.  A person without that would behave very differently.   For example, it's thought that one of the functions of having a conscious mind is the ability to picture in advance how other people see you, and how they will see you if you do certain things (""how will people respond if I say X?"").   In order to do that, we have created a mental symbol of ourselves in our own minds that we can look at from outside and manipulate in order to make predictions, which is a part of what consciousness is.    If a person had some kind of problem with their brain where they were unable to do that, where they were unable to be conscious of themselves, they would not be able to function in society.",Yosarian2,t1_ceim6kr_1,1389005069.0,2.0,t3_1uhj8f,3

Edit: I think that a key part of the reason that this feels so weird is that, compared to computers, are brains aren't very good at communicating with each other.   We can create all kinds of very complicated thoughts, but then to communicate them to someone else we have to resort to very low-information density mediums, like text or speech.  It's like a supercomputer with a 2400 bps modem; there's a lot going on in there, but it has trouble sharing that information with other computers.  Except we're even worse then that, since there's no way that speech or text can deliver 2400 bits of information per second.

138704,1991_B,"I don't necessarily disagree with you, as I believe everyone should be respected, but here is the argument I think makes the most sense with regards to why it may be ok (in the minds of many) to respect homophobes less than other people: Homophobes are not respectful of everyone. Since homophobes are not respectful of everyone simply for being human, many people consider them fair game to disrespect. Esseintially they forfeit their right to be respected by disrespecting others. I think this argument is a little hypocritical, at least how I phrased it, but it isn't entirely irrational. I am an American, and we tend to value freedom, but you quite simply can't have every freedom out there. You cannot allow all people to be free to have jobs and live where they like while also allowing perfect freedom to discriminate on the part of employers and landlords. Therefore the United States has been (slowly) siding more and more with limiting the freedoms that limit other freedoms. This is not the exact same thing but it is similar. Essentially the thought goes that we should respect the beliefs of all others, but when there is a conflict we will respect those who disrespect others less than those who don't.",rampazzo,t1_cdc0hlx_1,1384204660.0,3.0,t3_1qee3b,6

That being said, I do not respect all people equally. I have a fair amount of respect for everyone, but there are definitely some people who I respect more than others and some I hold in slightly lower regard. This is often a factor of a nubmer of things about a person. I value traits like kindness, loyalty, leadership, a good work ethic, creativity, intelligence, and open-mindedness, to name a few. When someone is pretty bad at some of these things I tend to respect them a little less than someone who displays them quite well. Homophobes are terribly closed-minded. I honestly find it impossible to respect a homophobe as much as another person who is equally respectable in every other way. It is definitely a knock against them. I try my best not to belittle them and to treat them with human decency (hold the door open, smile and be polite, be friendly, etc.), but only because I do that to everyone.

After some debate, everyone agreed that both proposals had merit, and decided to Congress a two part system.

PS. In my reply post I said the small states feared that the big states would not let them have a voice if Congress was based solely on state population.

First, I'll concede that everyone has a voice in Congress.  But the devil's in the details.  In the House, (the people living) in states w/ large populations have more sway because they have more delegates, and, in turn, more votes.  What the Senate does is make the playing field, between large and small states, by giving each  state two votes.  Lastly, a Senators primary job is being an ambassador (don't know another way to say it) for his state, as a legal entity, to the Federal Government, not representing his state's residents.

153852,2172_B,"There's a crucial, massively important difference between ""not guilty"" and ""innocent"". If someone stands trial for a crime and there's not *quite* enough evidence to make it obvious beyond reasonable doubt they are guilty, they'll have a not guilty verdict recieved- and that means if you rape someone, then hide the evidence well, you could feasibly not be found guilty of rape, then actually be able to force the (genuine) victim to prove they aren't lying, which would be fairly traumatic and a really strong disincentive to ever reporting sexual assualt when you don't have concrete evidence. As an example, OJ simpson was found not guilty of murder in criminal court, but then in a civil suit he was found guilty of manslaughter and forced to pay damages. The criminal court requires there be evidence beyond reasonable doubt whereas the civil court only requires  it's more likely than not that the crime was committed, so here even though the US justice system decided there was a &gt;50% chance he did it he was still found not guilty.
In Scot's law (IANAL but I'm pretty sure of this) there's an ""innocent"" verdict in addition to ""guilty"" and ""not guilty""- you *might* be able to argue that in situations in which an innocent verdict were returned the accuser should face trial, but even then you're going to discourage the reporting of abuse on the off-chance the abuser prepares for it and fabricates some kind of alibi",[deleted],t1_cc8dkwo_1,1379197073.0,7.0,t3_1mdwb3,7

So what happened was a drastic reduction in overall cycling in the city. Because there were suddenly much fewer cyclists on the road, the cyclists that remained were in more danger. So, though overall cyclist injuries decreased, injuries per number of cyclists actually went up.

However, I respectfully disagree with his position and furthermore that definition of natural. People arise from nature. Humankind's capacity to create, problem-solve, analyze, rationalize, and build also come from natural processes. How are the things we create unnatural?

I don't have a dad, so I can't speak for Father's Day, but if I gave my mom gifts every time I felt appreciation for her existence, she'd feel guilty for all the money I was spending.
