6769,75_B,"I've noticed that nearly everyone in Washington is extremely old.  I have always thought that that was a bad thing, because of a few reasons: 1. if you are already old, then the long-term consequences of your decisions probably won't happen until after you are gone, but will be horrible for all of us that are still around, 2. if you are already retired, then you wouldn't know what it is like for a working person today, especially someone struggling to live paycheck-to-paycheck.

TL;DR: old people shouldn't be in politics because the consequences of their decisions won't affect them, and they don't understand what the circumstances of today are.

For example, imagine a relatively long (30+ years) period of peace. All of a sudden, war is a possibility. I would like my decision-making body to have at least a few people who might have had prior experience with a war.

Additionally, when you elect someone, like your senator, you're not just electing them, you're also electing their entire staff.

6888,77_A,"I think some of the biggest threats to global stability comes from the political fringes. It's either the extreme left, or the extreme right. Radicalism almost always leads to violence, and is a plague on democratic society and governments. Since communism has been relegated to just a handful of countries, the far-left has for the most part been dealt with. However the far-right continues to be a menace.

I believe fascist neo-nazi groups, the KKK, the golden dawn or any religious extremist group like radical Islamism all fall under the far-right. These groups are always extreme fringes, and a handful of people make the world a much nastier place.

Often it is the leaders of such movements that prey on the weak-willed, using them as pawns in their ambitions of power.

Unfortunately with the world's obsession with free speech and personal liberty, such leaders are given a free hand. On websites like twitter and facebook we see ISIS recruit blind followers. Wouldn't restricting ""free speech"" put brakes on this sort of recruitment ?

Political parties in democracies often try to keep these groups on a leash, but do not wish to eliminate them since they serve definite political goals like polarizing the electorate. I see this as a major flaw in democracy. Fear of losing votes from radical sympathizers leads to political groups appeasing extremism.

Instead, I think governments should do much more and try to completely stamp out any signs of fascism. After the horrors of World War 2 I find it completely absurd that we still put up with their ideologies.

Bringing socio-economic growth to communities that feel disenfranchised just isn't enough, and their will always be a few bad apples. These bad apples need to be weeded out. Instead, we allow them to spread their rot, and infect society.

7051,77_A,"1. The limiting of extremist ideologies may make them more popular. See what happened to death metal. When you tell people things are bad, they will do them/be exposed to them.

2. The definition of extremism changes constantly. For example, The Church of Satan is a relatively inocuous group of essentially atheists, and we recognize that now. If someone tried to start that in the 1920s, they'd be swiftly shut the fuck down. The definition of extremism is too fragile and easily changed.

If someone advocated for gay rights in the 1850s, under your law, they'd probably be ""stamped out"".

3. Which brings me to this point - as you eliminate extremist thoughts, more and more moderate thought begins to be extreme. People will start self-policing their beliefs, and this leads to a loss of freedom.

4. This could be a tool for censorship. Anything could be called extreme.
Christianity? A religion about a man rising from the dead? Sounds like necromancy and death worship to me, ban it!

5. If you live in a society that values exchange of ideas, then you should know some skeptical principles. Anything could be correct. You look at ideas based on merit, not on what followers of that idea do. For example, ending Apartheid in South Africa took some violence on behalf of the anti-apartheid groups. Does that mean anti-apartheid, as an idea, was a bad thing? You're using actions to stamp out ideas.

6. Your post is politically biased.

7492,82_B,"I'll define a financial abortion as : Giving up the parental rights to a child you fathered. It involves not having to pay child support.

I've seen this concept floating around and initially dismissed it completely as guys wanting to shirk responsibility and be deadbeats. I also thought it could be too easily exploited, especially if men got cold feet about having a baby and, after claiming to support the woman, decided to screw her over by taking the financial abortion option.

However I've thought up ways in which such a law could actually be feasible.

1. If intending to get child support from the father of a child, the woman MUST inform him as soon as possible about the state of her being pregnant, at least by the 8th week. Maybe he can sign a document saying he knows she's pregnant.

2. The father can only decide to opt out and have the financial abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy. If he doesn't opt out by then, he loses the right to opt out. (The 10 week thing is because pregnancy is pretty obvious by then but the woman's body hasn't been morphed much it looks like. This can be changed, I just based it off looking at pictures.)

These laws mean that a woman can decide, with plenty of time left over for contemplating abortion, if she wants to keep a baby and raise it as a single mom. If she can't raise it on her own she might want to abort, with no great medical risk compared to the risks of pregnancy.

I think it would be immoral to bring a child into the world without being capable of providing for it. I think it is also immoral to force a man to pay for a child he didn't want. If a woman can't raise the child without the father's support the moral thing to do would be to abort the child.

This law would obviously be relying on abortion being freely available in the area. It would probably be a very bad idea to implement it in the South of the USA, for example.

So CMV that this law is feasible. I would like people to discuss loopholes, extenuating circumstances and also if this law would be unfair to women in any way. I would also REALLY appreciate it if people explained why they think this is distasteful along with their down vote. Frankly I'm sure people will find problems with this, VOICE THEM.

* Money is needed to raise a child properly.  

* Society say that parental personal finances are less important than raising a child properly.

A man is forced to raise the child properly and sacrifice his personal finances. This aligns with what we see as important in society.  This is the way it is now.

A man opts out of raising the child properly because he cares more about his personal finances.  This does not align with what we see as important in society.  So therefore society rejects financial abortion.

Native American or American is no better, however, when considering the origination of the term.

In either case we are claiming these indigenous people have no right to the original names they held such as tribe like navajo and apache and are required to be labeled as what the current foreigners see as fitting. Some native americans may agree with this term, but this has little to do with it being agreeable nomenclature and instead is a lesser of the evils in comparison to Savage, Featherhead, and now presently, Redskin.

That is not how the term Native American is used.  It is an overarching term for all of the native tribes.  Despite their differences, they do still have some things in common, and so we need a term to refer to them all as a collective group.  It is the same as calling someone European isn't saying that they don't have the right to be called Italian.  Similarly, calling someone Native American isn't the same as saying they don't have the right to be called Cherokee.

For the vast majority of students, History courses will have no applicable worth to them post-graduation. Almost no employer is going to care that you can list the reasons that the Roman Empire fell. So, why then, should I be required to pay thousands of dollars to take a course that has no real value to anybody with job aspirations?

* If your penmanship is that bad, type your homework. It can be done, it may not be fun, but it can be done.

* Homework is about communicating that you know the material and can obtain a correct solution to a problem. If you can't communicate clearly (write clearly) you should not get credit.

* A core of engineering is about communicating. No one cares what you have done/discovered if you cannot properly communicate it to others. So again, if you can't communicate clearly (write clearly) you should not get credit.

23206,318_B,"Often I hear the decision to not have a child described as selfish, but I see it the other way around.

When you become a parent, your brain chemistry changes and you biochemically become a completely different person. You've crossed the void and there's no going back, your life is your child's and no longer your own.

This is why parents can deal with baby's crying and pooping and general nastiness, because you are evolutionarily primed to love your child that much. Having a child is ~~objectively~~ a bad decision economically, time-wise, etc. However, the emotions that come with parenthood are indescribable for those without kids, it truly is a drug. 

Not having child is objectively a great decision, economically, time-wise, etc. However, you miss out on what a significant part of the human experience. Moreover, it is much easier to fall into a life that feels purposeless without a child as an easy answer.

When I weigh the two together, I can't help but come to the conclusion that having a child, getting high off of parenthood, and creating conscious and needy life is more selfish than using the resources you would use on the child to better the world. 

*I am making the assumption that instead of child-bearing the would-be parent involves him or herself in some sort of meaningful charity work*. I also want to be clear that *I'm not saying that having a child makes you a selfish person*, or even that having a child is necessarily selfish in and of itself. My view states only that it is more selfish than abstaining from parenthood.

Full disclosure, I am childless, extremely young, and completely unqualified to have a legitimate opinion on this topic. I'm not sure if I want children or not, but I don't want it to be a flippant decision. Interested to hear from some parents and others with more experience.

And most people who talk about how ""selfless"" parenthood is actually had kids *because they wanted kids*. Very few people don't want children but still *choose* to have them (accidents, of course, are a separate issue).

And it's also pretty easy to argue that, from a societal standponint, parenting is the less selfish option. There's a pretty persuasive paper about children being [public goods](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/2117807?uid=3739256&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21104912264287) - that link is to the official ""TL;DR,"" as it were. That's like a negative externality in reverse - parents shoulder a disproportionate cost of raising kids (the tax credits are a joke compared to the actual costs involved - and that's just the monetary costs; we're not even talking about time and other less tangible resources), while society reaps the benefit of a replacement generation.

Now - in a society with low infant/maternal mortality rates, it's good that so many people are opting to have no kids (or, like our family, opting to have just the one). But again, this is making virtue out of necessity: when presented with reliable contraceptives many people *choose* not to have kids, or to have fewer kids.

But with both parents and non-parents, the societal benefits are typically a side-effect, and not a major factor in the decision-making process. The choice is still made for selfish reasons.

So it's fine if you don't want kids - really, as long as you're not nasty to my kid for no reason, I couldn't care less what you do with your life. But when you're old, you will reap the benefits of having younger people to change your diaper and dispense your medication, diagnose and treat your numerous ailments, grow and transport your food, stock your supermarkets, keep your power on and put your fires out. If you don't think that today's kids (who are tomorrow's adults) will be of benefit to you, go read (or watch) *Children of Men* - it's not great literature or cinematography, but it sure is thought-provoking. 

It is therefore unreasonable to claim that parents are more selfish than the childfree. The motivations of both are equally selfish, and from a human-well-being perspective the outcomes skew somewhat in favor of the parents.",AnnaLemma,t1_clmbeod,1414521615,21,t3_2kkqbm,3
23208,318_B,"&amp;#8710; 

As a matter of fact I have seen (books are for squares!) *Children of Men*, and it's one of my favorite movies. I certainly appreciate children and see them as precious and necessary.

My argument falters because I was speaking in broad language while not thinking very broadly. While typing the original post up, I had a very clear image of a young couple deciding what to do with their lives. I did not intend to call into question parenthood. Clearly the language I used was misleading in that regard.

Apportioning ""selfishness"" to different lifestyle choices is a very tricky thing to do in most circumstances. It's difficult to speak in broad enough strokes to cover this big of a subject. 

Your delta comes into play because this was such a well written and well thought out response, and because I now feel that selfishness cannot be reasonably attributed to this situation.

However, I still do think a life of perfect humanitarianism is less selfish than a life of perfect parenting.

Your point of ""making a virtue out of necessity"" also resonated with me because that is my biggest meta ethical complaint. Most ethical systems are descriptive more than prescriptive, but feel a need to posture and claim some sort of universal imperative. That's a story for another day, though.

Thank you very much",spankythang503,t1_clmpmvx,1414546239,3,t1_clmbeod,3
23935,330_A,"I believe it benifits the economy as a whole. While undoubtly if Tesla sells directly to the public Teslas profits will be much higher, but if dealers were cut out the economy would be largly impacted. Car dealerships already have been in a decline since the internet became widespread and in ever household. Craigslist crushed the carmarket. Also, Carfax, kbb, etc. I know in the united states we like to think we have a free market economy, but its actually more of a mixed market economy. Without rules or regulations the big corperations would only get bigger and the other 99% would only get smaller. I guess what I'm trying to say is even if saving are passed down to the buyers there are many Americans that would be missing out on profitable opportunities. I know Tesla is only a small player in the car industry and probably makes up a less impressive chunk of the market, but what if car companies take notice to how much they profit by doing business this way and end up going that route. There is a car lot in every town in the United States of America. Many people would slowly start losing their jobs and the industry leaders would slowly become the only people who really profit from selling directly to consumers.

Also, Im sure you could get better deals from a GM owned dealership than you could from a local third-party owned dealership.  and if the public is getting better deals, that means they have more money to spend on other things, which is better for the economy.  particularly for people buying less expensive cars, because they are more likely to spend that money savings of other things which will help diversify the economy, and give them more ability to sustain their budgets.

I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.   

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report  

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.  

CMV, thanks in advance!

24783,335_B,"I like a number of aspects of the Nordic model but there are a few things you are not considering;

&gt; reduces poverty which benefits everyone.

Reduced poverty does indeed benefit everyone but when poverty rates are calculated the same way between advanced economies they are largely indistinguishable from one another, there is a fairly good analysis including some history [here](https://www.chapman.edu/research-and-institutions/economic-science-institute/_files/ifree-papers-and-photos/PriceFishback.pdf).

Largely where the US differs from other advanced economies is that our programs tend to be non-universal other then for old age transfers (which is the reverse of the rest of the world as it is universal where it generally isn't elsewhere), programs like public health are means tested where they are not elsewhere.

&gt; High level of education

The US actually has an identical tertiary enrollment rate to all the Nordic countries.

A fairly persistent problem in the US (its existed since the 80's) and to a lesser extent elsewhere is that even with a rise in education skills acquisition has been relatively flat, while people are entering and graduating from tertiary education at increased rates their marketable skills are not increasing. The problem here is caused by insufficient information being available to those embarking on tertiary education, they don't understand what the future value of their skills will be so make poor choices regarding which skills to acquire.

&gt; highly efficient administration

They are efficient due to their size, states of the same size are similarly efficient.

&gt; effectively invests into the society

You would have a hard time justifying the US doesn't also do so but just in different ways. Public science &amp; healthcare R&amp;D spending in the US is extraordinarily high compared to every other advanced economy (EG - The vast majority, nearly 90%, of worldwide public vaccine research spending is in the US), NiH and NSF actually fund research in the Nordic countries too.

&gt; providing multiple incentives

Which often fail. One of the reasons why Sweden went in a different direction in the 90's is due to their persistently high structural unemployment, having double digit unemployment even in a boom is a significant problem and poses a very significant mobility issue. In many of the countries today they are finding similar problems in education, people are becoming perpetual students obtaining degrees because they can rather then there is actually any value to them doing so.

&gt; angles of growth

Growth in Nordic countries is certainly below potential but more significant globalization creates a great deal of interaction between countries economies such that high growth countries with significant trade will necessarily increase growth in other countries. There is a good paper on the Nordic vs US models from this perspective [here](http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/jrobinson/files/varieties_of_capitalism_april_9_2013.pdf).

&gt; Low level of income inequality

Beyond the moral case its hard to make a case for inequality being bad, its simply not causal with any negative economic outcomes. Poverty &amp; mobility are the issues which actually do impact outcomes but always seem to take a back seat.

&gt; low crime

Check out Northern New England. US national figures are biased by a couple of places (DC particularly) which have very high crime rates.

&gt; good healthcare

Different healthcare then the US, better accessibility but lower quality of care; it largely depends on how you consider healthcare issues.

Beyond political reports we really don't rank healthcare systems of advanced economies, they all have good quality of care and all respond to local lifestyle &amp; political factors. The US is expensive but offers a wider array of treatment options then other countries, there are simply too many points of bias for any ranking to be useful so they are largely considered to be equivalent.

&gt; great education

Agreed, we spend the 2nd highest per child in the world and perform shockingly badly. K-12 is in desperate need of reform.

&gt; But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing

This is does do, nearly half of total world capital is available in the US. Net capital flows in advanced economies is towards to the US rather then away from it. As a good example even the European pharma's perform the majority of their R&amp;D in the US (EG - Most of GSK's R&amp;D is in MA). Capital created in the Nordic countries will typically end up in the UK or US.

&gt; sustainable economic growth.

As a quibble there is no such thing, all non-artificial growth is good for everyone. If we had a magic wand which would add 5% to growth immediate we should wave it, higher wages, reduced prices relative to incomes etc.

A better intermediate model which largely accomplishes what you are likely looking for would be the German system. Their healthcare system is incredible, the works council system is incredible (but currently illegal in the US) and while I don't think we need to legislate it in the same way the shared prosperity principles are really interesting.

25931,356_B,"This is almost a tongue-in-cheek CMV, but the argument still feels like it has a little bit of truth to me. Help me sort this out, would ya?

""Animals do not know any better, so they cannot be blamed for their actions (i.e. hunting and eating other animals)""

I would think one of the premises for the existence of rehabilitation efforts in prisons, for people who once felt it was okay to injure or kill other human beings, is that criminals can effectively be taught to ""know better"". Therefore, a person who believes eating meat is immoral should feel that the same rehabilitative efforts should be made for animals who hunt other animals. As they are, it is natural for them to hunt. However, it is also natural for murderers to murder when they commit their murders. We need to change what is ""natural"" for them -- reform the animals so that they no longer feel the need to prey upon others.

Of course, aside from the fact that this sounds a bit silly, I believe it is impossible to do. This would therefore lead a person who believes eating meat is immoral to the conclusion that predatory animals need to be put down, the same way that murderers who we deem cannot be rehabilitated would be issued a death sentence. Perhaps locking up carnivorous/omnivorous animals for life-term sentences could also suffice? In any case, it would seem that severe and immediate action needs to be taken.

The only way I feel you can get around this is to find a successful way of reverting wild animals' intrinsic tendencies to hunt others. But again, I do not feel like this is a realistic possibility.

Maybe I am just a bit tired or out of it, but I am strangely and surprisingly convinced by this line of reasoning. Thoughts?

**EDIT:** Not that it was really coming up in discussion so far or anything, but I did want to mention that I am pescatarian, and also support vegetarianism and veganism. Just a bit of (possibly unnecessary) background on me, if anything.

**EDIT 2:** This might be a clearer explanation of my view:

Let's just consider Person A who believes eating meat is wrong because it takes the life of another sentient being without its consent. Animals who hunt other animals take the lives of other sentient beings without their consent. Therefore, Person A believes that these predatory animals are doing something wrong. Person A should then feel that it is right for these animals to stop doing something wrong.

This may or may not represent my stance entirely (I am not quite sure myself), but it is at least a good summary of it.

**Final EDIT:** I think I am fairly satisfied with how this CMV turned out. Thanks for all your replies! It was simply a strange thought that I felt would be fun to try to argue about, but the CMV yielded some interesting conversations, at least for me. Thanks again!

I suppose these insects, arachnids, and sea creatures would have to be reformed, or perish, as well.

This might just be the worst-case scenario. A better result might be that we are able to identify and preserve many species that are able to live in a global ecosystem where only vegetarianism exists.

28296,398_B,"I don't really expect this to change your view about the persistence of this standard, but maybe the historical context will at least help you understand how it came about and that it did kind of make sense at one point.

Before the sexual revolution, premarital sex was a risky proposition for women. If it became known that she wasn't a virgin, it would severely impair her ability to find a desirable husband, and pregnancy could pretty much ruin her life.

But people still wanted to have sex ASAP. Enter the engagement ring, essentially earnest money for premarital sex. If her boyfriend made a major financial sacrifice, this indicated that he was serious about marrying her, because you don't spend that kind of money if your plan is to hit it and quit it. Plus, if he bailed she could sell the ring. Her mind at ease, she could sleep with him relatively secure in the knowledge that he really was going to marry her.

This doesn't work if the ring isn't a major financial sacrifice.

You're right about Mars being the only other *planet* with a chance of supporting life, but there are several moons in our solar system that scientists have speculated could support single-cell or even complex life forms (see [Titan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Titan) and Europa - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)#Potential_for_extraterrestrial_life (the link doesn't like reddit formatting).  Outside of our solar system, it seems almost impossible for life to be completely nonexistent.  We've confirmed the existence of almost 1800 planets that don't orbit our sun, and there are undoubtedly many more that we can't detect because our telescopes aren't precise enough.  Earth-like planets are also generally harder to detect than gas giants because they're so much smaller.

As to why we haven't detected any signs of intelligent extraterrestrials and why they haven't visited us yet, that's an unanswered question (see [the Fermi Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_paradox)).  It's extremely hard for the human mind to comprehend the insane distances between the stars.  It goes without saying that travel between them would be extremely impractical and astronomically expensive.  You then have to think about what would motivate an alien race to come and visit us.  Our solar system doesn't have anything particularly special when it comes to mineral resources.  Any species with the ability to travel here could undoubtedly maintain its own food, water, and fuel supplies by using materials that are much more accessible.  

Really, the only conceivable reason is to contact us, and then you have to consider how long we've been sending out detectable radio signals.  The first high-powered radio broadcast was during the height of the Nazi regime, only 70 years ago.  That means that any alien species would have to be less than 70 lightyears away to know that we even exist, and then to get to us they would have to organize a major interstellar space mission and travel all the way here.  Contrary to what science fiction tells us, space travel is unlikely to ever be what I would call convenient, and there isn't really much reason to come here.

Basically, we don't know if there's intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.  However, we can say that there isn't anything on Earth that would make it more able to support intelligent life that doesn't exist on a multitude of other planets in our galaxy alone.

Earth-like planets are also generally harder to detect than gas giants because they're so much smaller.

OK, I'm still not thoroughly convinced but you have helped open my mind to the possibility that there may be intelligent life out there.

31057,439_B,"I'm from the UK, and where I come from, we don't identify people by their race. ""African-British"" is something that's unheard of, and I feel that the common practice of labelling certain races as a part of a group of ""minorities"" in the US rather than labelling them by their nationality is in fact encouraging social inequality in a subtle way. When you refer to a large of people entirely based on their race and they themselves do as well, it may not seem wrong. Particularly when they are given equal opportunities and equal rights as the rest of the population. However, I argue that since their identity has been linked to their race nonetheless, it in fact encourages an image of separation. When you introduce yourself, you don't say ""I'm a Caucasian-American."" Yet it is normal for other races to introduce themselves as ""I'm African-American"" or ""I'm Asian-American"" when we should all be saying ""I'm American."" Because then if all races are indistinguishable from each other and are known by their nationality, then no subtle separation of identity happens and we can say we have realised equality on a small, social scale as well as the large, fundamental scale that we've achieved in recent decades.

When I talk to a ""minority"", I don't identify the colour of their skin as an important thing to take notice of when I later explain him or her to a friend. They're just a man or a woman. It's not complete social equality if you're referring to someone and including their race in the explanation, or they introduce themselves using their race as part of their identity when not all races engage in this.

A relevant clip from a 60 Minutes interview with Morgan Freeman may explain what I'm talking about more clearly:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh8mUia75k8

 **EDIT:** This got more comments and upvotes than I expected. Some of you already changed my view before this thread even hit 50 upvotes. I have a few points I need to briefly address.

I originally started this thread because I'm not really wholly ""British"" in regards to ethnicity - I'm mixed race. Half of my family originate from Armenia in blood ([which means I'm half Indo-European Aryan if the official Armenia website is to be trusted] (http://www.tacentral.com/people.asp?story_no=2)) and my other half are British by blood as well (Welsh, to be specific). However, the Aryan ethnic features are not white, blonde people with blue eyes as it's thought of, due to Nazism. I've been to Armenia, it's not the case. 

In recent weeks, I questioned how I should be identifying myself. Am I ""Armenian-British""? Am I really ""Aryan-British""? Should I identify myself as just ""Armenian"" or ""British""? Or ""Aryan""? Or ""Half Armenian, half British""? Which side of my family is more relevant in determining how I see myself?

Then I began asking myself how I would be perceived if I identified myself using any of the labels except ""British"". Would I be seen as a foreigner? Would it still be equal for me to publicly identify myself something other than my nationality or mixing that with my designated race when someone describes me? If that were the case, would people subtly view or judge me differently for it or think nothing of it? Does it depend on the person who learns this? Of course, I don't hold these views now.

These questions I had are what led to me to take the view that it wasn't still equal in that case - but I keep an open mind. So I asked you - and you definitely delivered in the ""(literal) boatloads"".

To those whom express a legal concern at my former proposal, you are right. For such a thing to done, thoughts and perceptions would need to be regulated, and Orwell would be livid. When I wrote this question, I intended to pose it in a theoretical light because it was only my view. I make sure I never consider my opinion as fact or a part of me. Particularly when I'm uncertain, similar to when I asked myself all those questions. Make you define your opinions, never make your opinions define you. To quote Tzu: ""Watch your words; they become actions."" I recommend everyone reads [u/essentialsalts] (http://www.reddit.com/user/essentialsalts)'s comment for a legal perspective on this proposal.

To those who commented and were of different races, you provided a very relevant perspective on this proposal, and I thank you for providing your arguments and insight. It was invaluable in helping me CMV.

This is an informative and extraordinary discussion on the relationship between race, identity, nationality and how that influences perception within an ever increasingly tolerant society. Thank you for giving your opinions and analyses on this. It was all a joy to read. Thank you for changing my view.

31262,439_B,"Not everyone wants to define themselves as just ""American"". The US has such a big mix of people, and there is a big difference between how each of them act and see the world. There also a difference in how each of these groups want to be perceived. Yes, we are all Americans, but I identify with my Indian culture as much as I do with the American culture I grew up in. Identifying as something other than Indian or Indian-American is something that I would personally never want to do. Different races have different view points on this, and this does have a lot to do with how their individual group is viewed by the rest of society; it also has to do with what context they are identifying in. 

My culture is something that is dear to me. It colors how I view the world. It makes me part of a more intimate society than simply being American. While it can be used in a negative light, there are also many positive ways in which it applies. This is true for any race/group identity. Why would I want to sacrifice that and instead identify as just American? What would that even mean? 

There is a huge difference between the kind of American that I am and the kind of American some white guy from California is. There is a huge difference between that guy and some white guy from Georgia for that matter. Would you have an issue with one identifying as a Californian and the other as a Georgian? How is this truly different from be identifying as Indian? We each grew up and interacted with a different culture. It gave us a different set of views and values.

33874,476_A,"Being the college freshmen that I am, I have very recent experience with the financial side to college. I have noticed it is very hard for upper middle class students to find ways to fund college. Schools give out little grants to them and the government gives out even less. This, however, is justified in my opinion. There is only so much to give out. On the other hand I found private scholarships to be the most frustrating. Every single one that I applied for was “based on financial need.“ My academic and philanthropic resume didn’t matter. All that was looked at was how much my parents made. 
	
I am not suggesting that I should attend college for free. I shouldn’t.  However, there should be more ways for middle class students to help aid them. Many times poorer students get money from the school and government, and then from private scholarships. I believe there should be better ways for middle class students to find scholarship money to help them pay for college.

34851,496_A,"Let me make one thing clear at the start: this is NOT a comparison of Android vs. iOS. This is a comparison of the hardware of all the flagship phones on the market right now. This post was inspired by [this](http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/11/5797664/the-best-smartphone) post from the Verge (and no, I don't think there is an iVerge bias there). The points that they present are very valid. The iPhone 6 has the most compromise-free experience of any flagship today. It has a great camera, great specifications, great size, good battery, and a good software experience. The runner up, the 2014 Moto X, is a close contender, but it has sacrifices in the camera and the battery. What I would consider the best Android that I have used, the Nexus 5, still has questionable battery life.
So, I'd like you guys to prove me wrong, or somehow change my view. (Again, this is exclusively hardware, NOT software. That's a whole 'nother debate)

EDIT: A clarification of my viewpoint:

My case is that, of all the flagship phones on the market *right now* (That would be: 2014 Moto X, LG G3, HTC One M8, One Plus One, Samsung Galaxy S5, Samsung Galaxy Note 4, iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus,  Sony Xperia Z2, Nokia Lumia 1520, and yes, the Nexus 5) the iPhone 6 offers the most comprehensive hardware experience. In my opinion,  it is compromise free. When someone goes to buy an iPhone 6 (assuming that they had weighed all of their options and not just gone with the hype), they would not be purchasing it in spite of some hardware compromise, i.e. battery life, screen size, camera, processor, screen quality, or another hardware point of comparison.

35137,504_B,"(I chose these criteria since other elements of ""greatness"" like history, excitement level, fun, culture of the fan base, universality, are much harder to quantify.)

EDIT: To further clarify, these criteria were chosen because they are fundamental to how the game is played. 

While I don't think American football is superior to all other sports in all of these criteria individually, the sum of the skill, athleticism and strategy required in American football makes it great.

For example, it probably takes more skill to hit a 90 mph fastball or complete a gymnastics routine than to play football. It probably takes more athleticism to run a competitive marathon time or endure an MMA fight. I will say that I can't immediately think of a more strategic sport than football (more on that in a bit). Though football isn't the greatest in all three categories, it requires a great deal of each.

Skill is probably the weakest of the three criteria for football, but football is unique in the number and variety of skills required to make a football team function; each position has to do things the others don't. Quarterbacks have to be able to assess the movements of the other 21 players all at once and hit a small, rapidly moving target. Receivers have to catch a ball while running at full tilt with less than a second to get a visual lock. Linemen use a type of wrestling technique to clear the way for running backs (or shut down running backs/attack the quarterback in the case of the defensive line.) Kickers and punters have to kick with considerable precision over great distances. Defenders have to take down 200 pound men running full speed without committing a foul; this requires technique and precision, not just strength. I don't think there are many other sports where the roles/skills of each position are as distinct. 

While it's true that play stops and starts frequently, every second of active play is done at full intensity. There's never a period reserving energy or waiting for a situation to develop or waiting for the action to come back to the other side of the field (The only time play slows down is in the late stages of the game when one team has a substantial lead). Linemen have to wrestle 300 pound men with all their might for the entire game. Offensive players have to run at full speed every play while enduring repeated physical trauma. Defenders also have to run at full speed and exert enough strength to knock down other players doing the same. I think football could almost be likened to high-intensity interval training with the added twist of getting knocked to the ground repeatedly by large men. This requires a great deal of athleticism and endurance.

Where football especially shines is strategy. Each play requires all 22 players on the field to carry out a very specific action. Players have to memorize a playbook with dozens to hundreds of plays and be able to execute these actions perfectly from memory. If even one or two players of the 11 on a side fails to carry out the play correctly, the play will likely fall apart. Each play is carefully selected based on a great deal of factors, including the strengths and weaknesses of the 22 players on the field, the position of the ball on the field, whether or not the clock is moving, how much time is left, the score and how many downs are remaining. But what's especially unique is that coaches have to predict what the other team will do and outwit them. Football is the only sport where players spend as much time on the intellectual aspects of the game (learning strategy and studying other teams' strategies) as they do developing skills and conditioning their bodies. Football is an 11-on-11, three-hour chess match. No other sport has strategy that involves that level of detail.

I invite you to change my view by demonstrating that another sport requires a great deal of all three criteria, and the sum of that sport is greater than that of American football.

35173,504_B,"I would contend that boxing's sum of skill, athleticism and strategy surpass football's. As you mentioned, you said that in the athleticism category, MMA&gt;Football. I'm putting boxing as approximately as athelitically taxing as MMA, thus boxing&gt;football with respect of athleticism.

Strategically, boxing involves both in-ring and out-of-ring factors. Mike Tyson was famous for intimidating opponents before the fight. Muhammad Ali used his celebrity and political clout to affect the psychological issues in-ring (as well as using his in-ring skill to influence things politically). I think this puts the strategy involved in boxing as being at least comparable to that of American football.

As an aside though, it seems that Football coaches are [not terribly good strategically](http://static.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/garber_greg/1453717.html)

While the game might be strategic, if the coaches play an orthodox style, and ignore the subtle strategy, what good is the game having strategic depth in the first place? Chess has a ton of strategic depth, that doesn't mean that chess novices display any appreciable amount of strategy.


I think skill is the most difficult to quantify, but what I will say is that boxing, unlike football requires a wide variety of skills, footwork, form, endurance, strength, etc, while football players are more specialized.

I think that this shows that even if American football has slightly more skill, the lack of strategic depth and lower athleticism make boxing a far superior sport based on the criteria you've given.",[deleted],t1_ckrm2w9,1411598524,3,t3_2hcsbm,3

Good case for boxing. I think boxing definitely wins on athleticism and skill. It takes a lot of training to throw and take good punches in addition to the aspects you mentioned.

45843,665_B,"This thread was motivated by the commentary in this r/worldnews thread: http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2e431s/police_warn_sharing_james_foley_killing_video_is/

If you haven't been following the news, an extremist group called ISIS recently released a video showing their execution of an American journalist, along with some propaganda for their cause and a warning to those who would resist them. Police in England are warning that it may be illegal to download or distribute this video.

I don't think it's too hard to understand my view. ISIS created a video which required irreversible harm to someone in order to create. They aren't interested in making a monetary profit, they're interested in spreading their message to people. When you view the video, you're showing them that there is demand for more of this content, and they've demonstrated they're willing to kill more prisoners. The family of James Foley has gone on the record requesting that people don't view the video out of respect for James.

Child pornography can be created for a few different reasons. A large amount of child pornography is created not for profit, but simply to exchange with others. These videos and images may require irreversible harm in their creation, and by downloading and viewing them you are creating a demand for further production of that content. I would imagine that given the choice, the victims of child pornography and their families would give the same plea that the Foley family did to avoid watching or spreading the video.

It's interesting to me that everyone in the r/worldnews thread thought it was completely absurd to make viewing the execution illegal, while I'm fairly sure none of them would want to legalize free child pornography. I'm not advocating that either of these things should be legal or illegal, I'm just having a hard time understanding why they occupy such a different legal space in much of the world. 

One argument I forsee is that many people are downloading the Foley video out of a morbid curiosity, while people who download child pornography are doing so to enjoy the content. Whether or not I enjoy content is of little concern. The fact remains that if I enjoy child pornography, I would continue to view it again, and if I had the morbid curiosity to view an execution, I would likely have that same urge the next chance I got. There are also people viewing the Foley video in parts of the world which support ISIS, so I don't believe that there is nobody enjoying it.

Thanks in advance for any input! I've never posted on reddit before, and I just made this account because I didn't think anyone else was going to ask this question.

EDIT: My view has been changed in light of the vast majority of child pornography falling under U.S. Obscenity law, while the execution video wouldn't. Although I now understand the legal difference that exists, I have a  big problem with obscenity laws themselves, but that's an issue for another day. Thanks for everyone who gave me some input, it was fun!

It was used to justify the bombing of centres of population in World War II, but more recently it has been used by terrorist organisations, especially Al Qaeda, to justify attacks on civilians including 9/11.

It has also been an argument used by Israel.  In 1982 Menachem Begin stated that Lebanese casualties of Israeli air raids were no different to those suffered by Denmark in Allied air raids in World War II.  As recently as 2006, Benjamin Netanyahu and Shimon Peres dismissed British criticism of air strikes in Lebanon by pointing out that Britain ought to understand Israel's actions as it mirrored the strategy used by Bomber Command in World War II.  He even specifically drew a link between ketyusha rockets launched at Israel and the German V2 programme.  There is a patent absurdity in this particular analogy, but there is no legal or ethical justification for the targeting of civilians.

Israel is party to all 4 Geneva Conventions, the fourth of which makes specific provision for the protection of civilians.  As well as requiring a country’s actions to be proportionate, to discriminate between military and civilian facilities and to be humane, the fourth convention also states civilians are to be treated identically regardless of nationality, race, political opinion or religion.  So whilst there are questions to be asked about whether Israel’s actions are proportionate, discriminate or humane, it is obvious that under international law a civilian cannot become a target based on their political choices.",Badgerfest,t1_cjsl6il,1408272851,14,t3_2dsd7q,3

48710,723_B,"In the wake of Robin Williams' death, there's been a lot of discussion in the community about depression, which I think is great. The more awareness for what it is, the better.

I have a few viewpoints on this subject that I would like to get out there because it's been bothering me.

Little background: I've never been clinically diagnosed (I'll get to why later), but for the first 2 years of college, something weird happened. I went from having great grades in high school and a lot of friends, to finding myself literally holing up in my dorm room every night and every weekend. I gained roughly 50 pounds over those 2 years, and I was failing all my classes. I wasn't even able to muster the effort to put the work in. Also, I distinctly remember having suicidal thoughts. I never actually thought I would go through with any of them, but it occupied my mind quite a bit. 

I wanted to change. I desperately tried. But nothing was clicking. I definitely read a little bit into depression during this time, and I figured that I had some minor variant of it. I wanted to reach out and talk to someone but I figured that I could handle it on my own. I read a lot into depression and overcoming it, and I knew that exercise and a better diet would help but I still wasn't able to do any of that. Like I couldn't get myself to do what I know I needed to do. It pissed me off. I blamed myself for that, and I still do. 

So here's where it gets interesting, and here's where I hope some of you can shed light on this topic. This was almost 3-4 years ago so I'm forgetting exactly where the shift happened, but the summer after my 2nd year I started reading a lot into Zen Buddhism and Stoicism and this COMPLETELY changed my view on the world and my life. What I realized was that my thoughts are in my head (obviously), and that I can be in control of them. I realized that I was putting positives and negatives into certain situations, when the situation is neutral by default. The big thing for me was realizing that the world isn't mean or nice, it's indifferent. It literally gives no fucking shits about any of us. So I think what happened to me was that I had an expectation of reality that was different from reality itself. I believe this caused my 2 year downward spiral to a point where I was an utter failure, friendless, and alone. 

This was definitely a ramble but I hope it made some sense. I'm at a point in my life now where I'm having a hard time remembering EXACTLY how I felt during that period, but I definitely remember that I would sometimes cry in the shower and do other things of that nature. I was literally alone for 720 days straight. I would just wake up and sit in my room the entire day. I would ask for extensions and still not be able to muster up any assignments.

At the time I saw that as a character flaw, and now I still see it as a character flaw. So does this mean that I see depression as a character flaw? I also learned that a lot of people go through similar bouts. Maybe not quite as intense (rarely quite so intense...to the point where it is affecting your future), but definitely something noticeable. So if I can get through it with reading books and changing my mental attitude, why can't everyone else? Why can't we all realize that life isn't fun and games, that it's indifferent. Our thoughts CAN be controlled. I couldn't control them before, but now I can. It's not an overnight process; it took me about 3 years to go from that fateful summer of meditation and Stoicism to where I am now. I'm at a point now where I can objectively evaluate the things that are going on in my life, and even if they're ""bad"", I can handle it.

So instead of popping pills and getting electric therapy, why don't we medicate people with depression with books and meditation and a MENTAL SHIFT, instead of a chemically-induced whatever-a-pill-is?

BTW, this same thing applies to anxiety. I went from having crippling anxiety to...still having crippling anxiety, but it's gotten better. I went from not being able to hold a conversation without panicking, sweating, almost crying, to being able to hold conversations for as long as necessary. Again, this all happened without meds. This happened with a mental shift that I induced through books and meditation.

I guess I'm wondering if someone can explain to me why the go-to method is popping pills and therapy, when I know for a fact that you can bootstrap your own healing? I'm not saying to man up or buck up, I'm saying to realize that ""it's all in your head"" and that you don't have to be a slave to it. Meditation and self-help books helped me with that a lot.

TL;DR: Pills are unnecessary for depression and anxiety. They're just character flaws that can be changed with practice. Obviously this doesn't apply to the fringe cases (like Robin Williams or others who commit suicide) but definitely applies to the majority of people who claim they're depressed or anxious.",trKid92,t3_2djqwm,,,ORIGINAL_POST,9

You know for a fact that *you* were able to bootstrap *your own* healing. And now you're trying to generalize everyone with depression and anxiety.

How do you know the majority of cases are like your own? Have you considered the possibility that your experiences with depression and anxiety are different from the typical person?

Sometimes medication works, sometimes it doesn't. Sometimes a person is able to overcome their mental health issues without them, sometimes they aren't. Everyone is different and everyone experiences things differently.",BenIncognito,t1_cjq6s23,1408040194,27,t3_2djqwm,9

Person A: Gets teased. Can't deal with it. Cries to his mom. Does nothing to advance the situation. Externalizes problems.

Person B: Gets teased. Figures out a legitimate action plan to deal with it. Realizes that he may have been overreacting. Recognizes that this is a long process that could take a while, but at least he or she has a first step.

Problems with motivation is a pretty big symptom of depression, so you're bashing people for exhibiting signs of the mental health issue they're currently struggling with. If it was so easy to just get up, see the world in a positive way, and start working out everyone would do it.

It seems strange to me to say that showing signs of depression is a character flaw or a weakness. That's like asking people with the flu to stop sneezing and then telling them they're weak for not being able to stop it.

I've struggled with depression for a long time, and the idea that my depression is something I could just will myself out of only ever made me more depressed and prevented me from taking the actual steps that would help me.",BenIncognito,t1_cjq949p,1408044212,9,t1_cjq8w4w,9
48717,723_B,"&gt;Problems with motivation is a pretty big symptom of depression, so you're bashing people for exhibiting signs of the mental health issue they're currently struggling with.

Sort of. I guess what I'm going for is that it's not a mental health issue most of the time. Again, for the fringe cases, TOTALLY different story. But I see my classmates and friends always citing anxiety and depression as the reason they can't get themselves to work, yet all I see is laziness, incompetence, and an inability to understand that success (however you define it) takes work. Whether success is good relationships, or good money, or what have you. At some point, something's gotta give. Are you going to give in, or are you going to fight back? Everything we do everyday is a choice. Recognizing that helps a lot in this battle.

EDIT:

&gt;If it was so easy to just get up, see the world in a positive way, and start working out everyone would do it.

First off, I never said it was easy. I said it took me years to get to that point. So it's definitely not easy.

Second off, I never said to view the world in a positive way! It's indifferent. That's the way I see it that has helped me the most.

Third off, your point about everyone doing it just isn't true. This isn't true for humans in general. Most of us, including myself, tend to be lazy, etc. That's why you have a lot of unambitious people who say they'll work out in the new year, and stop going to the gym after February. Laziness, plain and simple.",trKid92,t1_cjq9a7r,1408044506,-8,t1_cjq949p,9

You can't say for certain that people who claim to have depression are usually not having a mental health issue. Regardless, if this were the case, medication would not help them. There is no pill for ""laziness"" so if taking antidepressants made your lazy friends less lazy, perhaps they actually had depression.

Anyway, people who take medication for depression *are* fighting it. They went out to a doctor seeking help and they got it. You act like they're giving up, but it's quite the opposite.",BenIncognito,t1_cjq9g7m,1408044801,13,t1_cjq9a7r,9

&amp;#8710;

That's fantastic. Never thought of it that way. This will provide some interesting observations in the coming weeks when I view my friends and classmates.

Question: If a person cities their laziness due to depression, and then gets treated for depression (CBT and pill-popping), what happens if they're still lazy? Then can I correctly categorize them as weak-willed individuals? After all, if you think your leg pain is being caused by cancer (wut) and you get treated for cancer and your leg pain persists, then we need to look elsewhere, right?

EDIT: Just out of curiosity, do you have any studies about depression pills? Like what exactly they do and how testing has worked? I'm really interested in seeing whether they improve people's ""peripheral"" lives e.g. they start exercising more and eating better and becoming motivated.",trKid92,t1_cjq9nym,1408045181,3,t1_cjq9g7m,9
57518,842_B,"I have found that the phrase ""Intolerant of intolerance"", and the whole liberal movement, is just as closed and intolerant as anyone else, just about new things. I often come across liberal minded thinkers, who say that everyone is entitled to their opinion and should be accepted no matter who they are, yet they refuse to accept people they deem as intolerant for who they are. This seems to include massive groups, such as organized religion, people opposed to same sex marriage, conservatives, non western cultures that have non liberal views, such as arabic culture having a different idea of gender roles (if it's a culture that is more similiar to our own, then it falls under the protected liberal category), and various others. I have also seen this view extended to a desire to remove some of their basic freedoms, most notably freedom of speech and the freedom to congregate.

To clarify, I am not asking to debate individual views of the liberal community (women's rights, gay rights...). I would like to understnad, and perhaps change my view, on how if acceptance and tolerance is such a priority for liberals, how they can reject such massive swaths of humanity as unacceptable and intolerable?

Thank you for your time.

EDIT: I accidentally said in favour of same sex marriage instead of opposed to. That has been changed

57582,842_B,"I never really viewed it as a case of ""intolerant of intolerance."" Couching your racism, homophobia, sexism, etc. as religious text or scientific observation isn't the only part of what people tend to dislike about those groups. It's that they want to turn their hate into policy. Gay people can't get married, black people need their own schools, women shouldn't join the military, etc. 

The difference I see is that people who dislike intolerance aren't saying you aren't free to believe or live how you want but that you have no right to dictate that to other people. Hate groups aren't trying to keep to themselves. They are shaming women going into planned parenthood for getting a mammogram. They are standing in front of city hall tell gay people to get out of their city. 

So really it isn't that you can't be intolerant, it's that your intolerance isn't allowed to dictate how other people live and people won't let you terrorize others into submission. You have a right to say what you want within reason. If you're inciting violence against a particular group of people, you're not free from consequence. Likewise, you're not free to harass people in public (I'm assuming by congregation you mean the safety circles outside Planned Parenthood clinics). ",videoninja,t1_cj6r7su,1406234383,1,t3_2bmble,5
57583,842_B,"I hear what you are saying. This is often a go to answer, and it is quite reasonable. You can think whatever you want, as long as you don't tell people how to live. The question I have, however, is this. When a society is deemed to be doing intolerant things (say arabic culture where gender roles might be considered an infringement on women's rights), do you believe you shouldn't tell them how to live?

Alternatively, for people who believe gay marriage is a terrible environment for a kid to grow up in, and feel a poor child is being disadvantaged, should they still not tell them how to live?",petgreg,t1_cj6rxlt,1406235625,2,t1_cj6r7su,5
57584,842_B,"To answer your question: change has to come from within the society itself. You can't fight other people's battles for them, you can only act as an ally. That being said, if you are aiding a woman in an Arabic society who is fighting against her oppression, go ahead. If you are, however, trying to give ""help"" to people who never asked for it then you need to take a step back. 

For your second question, the answer is no, short of actual physical abuse taking place, you don't have a right to dictate how parents raise their children. If that were true then we could snatch children away from ignorant or hateful people using the same logic. 

To bring this all back to your original idea, the concepts at play here are multi-factorical. Just because I'm tolerant of your behavior doesn't mean you are free from consequence. There are lines and degrees as to what merits harsher consequences and it's highly contextual. That's just how society is. To try to dilute those concepts into some over-simplified concept such as ""intolerant of intolerance"" seems disingenuous to me.

-In conclusion, I really dont see how these driver-less cars are a possibility, but hopefully someone can inform me and possibly change my opinion, thanks!

-Finally, there are simply too many people who wouldnt trust a system like that. For example, many people are too afraid to ride on a plane because it is out of there control, however they are comfortable driving long distances, even though it is statistically much more dangerous.

58013,853_B,"I feel uniquely qualified to answer this because I'm working with a group building an autonomous car (its a small one though, I'm not a googler), and I just wrote a research paper on the ethical and legal implications of such vehicles.

&gt;Most importantly large insurance companies will take a hit from this, and we all know who calls the shots in the US government, the big corps

Amablue covered this well, but a few additional things

First, [California and Nevada already have significant groundwork for autonomous vehcles](http://ojs.stanford.edu/ojs/index.php/intersect/article/view/361), and while it is still vague and infant, it does require insurance
&gt;Although these pieces of the policy set the foundation 9 Intersect Vol 5, No 1 (2012)
&gt;for testing cars in Nevada and future regulation, they do not provide 
&gt;enough details to sufficiently address the liabilities posed by technical and 
&gt;non-technical issues. For instance, part b only discusses insurance briefly, 
&gt;saying the state must, “Set forth requirements for the insurance that is 
&gt;required to test or operate an autonomous vehicle on a highway within this 
&gt;State.” (bottom of p8 - top of p9)

&gt;To be fully effective, all cars on main roads would have to be automated. How would this happen logistically?

So, this isn't true.  We already know that driverless cars are safer

&gt;[We ran Bush’s claim by Bryant Walker Smith, a fellow at the Center for Internet and Society at Stanford Law School, who wrote a paper on the legality of automated cars. (The center publicly discloses its donors, which include Google and some car companies.) He said driverless cars haven’t traveled enough miles yet to prove their safety.](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/mar/25/jeb-bush/driverless-car-has-gone-300000-miles-without-accid/)

&gt;[Based on the number of car crashes in the United States and the miles traveled, he concluded that Google's cars would need ""to drive themselves (by themselves) more than 725,000 representative miles without incident for us to say with 99 percent confidence that they crash less frequently than conventional cars. If we look only at fatal crashes, this minimum skyrockets to 300 million miles. To my knowledge, Google has yet to reach these milestones.""](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2013/mar/25/jeb-bush/driverless-car-has-gone-300000-miles-without-accid/)

Specifically

&gt;Google's cars would need ""to drive themselves (by themselves) more than 725,000 representative miles without incident for us to say with 99 percent confidence that they crash less frequently than conventional cars.

And as of May 2014,
&gt;[The last we had heard of Google's self-driving car project was in August 2012, when Google announced that the cars had driven 300,000 autonomous miles. Today, that number has more than doubled to **700,000**, and Google's cars are now tackling driving in the big city.](http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/04/googles-self-driving-cars-hit-700000-miles-learn-city-navigation/) (emphasis mine)

And Google's vehicles are designed to work around terrible human drivers, in fact, Google has no plans to implement inter-vehicle communication anytime soon because it isn't necessary.

&gt;Would the automatic driving capabilities be installed, or would you need a whole new car?

[Well, this is actually possible](http://www.wired.com/2014/06/cruise-self-driving-car-startup/) although I personally doubt the claims this startup makes.

&gt;If you need a car built for this then what would happen to all the old ""dumb"" cars?

I think the above link explains this reasonably

&gt;And who would pay for all the dumb cars to be re purposed?

Consumers, insurance companies, google, who knows, it would probably be done slowly over 10s of years, not overnight.

Now onto the responses you sent at Amablue:

&gt;I agree there is alot of corps on both sides of the issue here. Dont you think that will create a political gridlock, and these things will never be mandated?

Well, US law is weird in that unless things are specifically prohibited, they are generally allowed, autonomous cars kind of fit this niche (amablue please correct me if I'm committing an atrocity of misunderstanding law)

&gt;How will a road system work if its, say, 50/50 automated and manual cars? If half the traffic is unpredictable human drivers how will the automated cars know what to do with an expectation of safety?

Google's autonomous vehicles learn from interaction.  The more situations they face, and they more they are exposed to unpredictable human drivers, the better they get at predicting and reacting to them.  The vehicles are consistently driven less and less by their human controllers as they learn to handle more situations.  Although, for example, because they have only driven in certain parts of CA, they don't handle roundabouts well at all.  Its a matter of exposure and, for lack of a better term, ""practice"".

&gt;Unlike other technologies like phones, computers and tvs, cars are very expensive and can easily last 25+ years so will take a very long time to just fade out.

Indeed, but many can be retroffitted, and some mainstream cars already use pseudoautonomous systems, like cruise control that also steers for you (I think Audi does this, but they require that your hands be on the wheel), it will obvious be a process, but it'll happen.

&gt;You say self driving cars will be safer and have many benefits, where is the evidence to support that, and more importantly where is the evidence to support that having many automated cars on the road is even possible? 

So as I said, statistically, there's a 99% chance they crash less than human drivers, that's a huge point for their safety.  As for the evidence that you can have many on the road, [here's a video of one driving on the open road, with a blind man in the driver's seat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cdgQpa1pUUE).  While the videography makes it hard to see, you can see other vehicles on the road from time to time, they can obviously maneuver around other vehicles.

&gt;Or is this all just speculation? Im not trying to be stubborn, but studies and evidence is worth a lot more than opinions.

I mean sure, some of it is, but hopefully this helped.",zardeh,t1_cj4w7lb,1406071203,3,t3_2bffjw,5
58014,853_B,"Wow thanks for the reply! I definitely will look at this issue differently, however the stat that theres a 99% chance they crash less than human drivers means little(if I understand it correctly). So how much less of a chance does it actually have to get in an accident than a human driver. Also know this statistic- there is 1.27 automobile fatalities per 100 million miles traveled and there are 153 non fatal accidents for every fatal one. That is about 194 accidents per 100 million miles traveled, rounding that up to 200 means there is an accident every 500,000 miles on average. In googles testing they ran it for 700,000 miles and there where 2 accidents, I know neither where the softwares fault but still, its not as impressive as it may seem.",I_am_a_asshole,t1_cj4wlfj,1406071941,0,t1_cj4w7lb,5

While I wouldn't think a maximum sentence was necessary some form of punishment would be. ~~As a society if this is allowed to happen then the door is open for people to take justice into their own hands, and that is a very dangerous concept.~~

As a side note I'm sure some examples of it going this way can occur, but for everyone against my view that is provided I could find one supporting it. So the discrepancy between cases is another problem in this as well. 


Edit: My view has shifted from thinking full charges are necessary to reduced charges are fine. My main problem is that they are rarely brought to trial.

Edit 2: Vigilante part is gone. Now it's down to the core view.

59189,874_B,"The law already makes allowances for an affirmative defense in criminal proceedings. In an affirmative defense, the accused admits to committing the criminal act but provides a justification or excuse for their actions--duress, necessity, insanity, self-defense, etc. In such cases, a successful affirmative defense reduces or even entirely removes culpability for a criminal act. One famous example of an affirmative defense was ""the burning bed"" case, where a battered woman essentially lost her mind and burned up her abusive husband while he slept. She was found not guilty of murder by reason of temporary insanity. So, while she faced consequences for her actions, the jury decided that she was not of sound mind at the time and therefore not responsible.

Prosecutors generally have a fair amount of discretion when deciding whether to bring charges against an individual for criminal actions. They must weigh the cost of a trial against the probable outcome based on the strength of their case. I can't imagine that too many prosecutors would be willing to spend the time and money to prosecute a person for assaulting someone who *in the process* of raping their child. It is highly likely that a jury would be willing to excuse such behavior, especially in the heat of the moment, and the trial would be a waste of taxpayer money.

&gt; I could excuse some degree of injury to the perpetrator, but their are countless cases of parents severely or even kill the perpetrator, and I feel like this should face penalty under the law.

Countless cases of vigilante assault and/or murder that are never charged? I find this difficult to believe. I found a case of a Texas man who wasn't charged when he beat the man raping his daughter to death, but again, he caught the rapist in the act and Texas law allows for lethal force when addressing aggravated sexual assault. Another woman actually faced consequences for shooting a man accused of raping her son, and she was convicted of a lesser charge in her first trial phase.

He or she is a committing a violent act against a close loved one. There's no telling how violent he or she might be in response to being interrupted.

*The Bell Curve- The Bell Curve is a 1998 scientific book by Richard Herrnstein and Charles A. Murray, in the book a racial IQ gap is described that has prominent races in the allowing order(from least intelligent to most): blacks, whites, Asians, jews. Subsequent books have been published by Murray supporting his data. 

*Minnesota Transracial Adoption Studies- This study had adopted children of White, black, asian, and mixed decent take IQ test at age 7 and 17, not surprisingly the white children scored highest, then mixed, and finally black. Interestingly mixed children, wether raised to believe they were black or mixed scored the same, which strongly implies IQ is hereditary. This study was also done by a group of people who considered themselves racial equalist. 

*Arthur Jensen studies- during these test blacks and whites were given a sequence of numbers to remember, and there scores were about the same; however, when they asked to repeat the numbers backwards, the blacks did significantly worse. 

*African civilizations have done substantially worse than european civilizations, additionally sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest mean IQ score, bordering on retarded

*The brain of the average black has been shown to have differences for the brain of the average white or Asian man.

The Bell Curve and Minnesota Studies are old (though the Minnesota Studies did have follow up in the 90s and early 2000s, that's still old in the realm of scientific research). The Bell Curve wasn't even peer reviewed before publication and the American Psychological Association went on record to say that the authors never definitively proved a genetic link with intelligence, particularly in regards to race. The Minnesota Studies have a really small sample size and poor controls for confounding variables. Perhaps it might help if you read the discussion in the studies as the authors themselves admit the study's results are nothing conclusive. I can't speak to the Jensen studies since I've never seen them but look at the statistics (p-values, confidence intervals, etc) and the discussion. Anything show up as statistically significant and did they account for their confounding variables? 

In regards to African civilizations... well which ones specifically? Africa is a huge continent and everyone kind of lumps it an entirely war-torn and destitute but that's not true of every single country or culture. In fact, Nigerians are one of the US's most highly educated immigrant demographics. Also, a country's GDP isn't really a definitive indicator of population intelligence.

You'll find the more you delve into the technical side of it, we don't have a set definition on what constitutes ""intelligence"" and the measures surrounding it are still controversial. While IQ tests do have generally agreed upon reliability and validity in measuring ""intelligence"", many cognitive neuroscientists agree it only measures a certain kind (while others accept them as canon). If an entire professional community can't come to a conclusive agreement on the concept of intelligence, do you think your belief supersedes that reality?

69046,1015_A,"Without getting specific as to which ones are worse or denying the necessity of anti-virus software in general for you know, viruses. The secondary purpose (to me at least) of such programs is to keep your computer clutter free from adware, popups, and generally keep it running smooth and fast. While this not being as bad as getting a Trojan, if your internet usage is kept relatively simple by mainly visiting places like Reddit and such, many if not all free AV software hit you with a constant barrage of auto-updates, mini scans, and popups for ""discounted offers"" to upgrade that in effect, slow your computer down more than anything. This only gets worse when trial offers expire and you now have popups AND nothing protecting you. Yes, I know there are work arounds such as changing settings and uninstalling when expired, but this isn't the point. Besides, sometimes, this won't even work. Currently, for example, one noted AV software is running a ""World Cup Promotion"" and constantly pops up an ad about it. Not saying this is horrible, but I'm starting to feel like the programs are becoming more and more malware like every day.


EDIT: Let me share that AVG, Norton, Avast, &amp; AdAware are on the list of AVs I would fit into this category.

It changes your default homepage and search engine mainly. Neither of these are hard to fix nor is getting rid of it (which you have to do to keep you changes).

69085,1015_A,"I think your complaint is geared towards specific antivirus programs you used and doesn't really apply to the whole category of free antivirus programs. 


For example, I have never paid for an antivirus program. In fact I would go as far as to say some paid programs are way worse than the free ones. Mcafee would be one, along with Norton (which for some reason got onto your list even though its clearly paid. Free trials are not free antivirus programs). The set up I've been using for a while is microsoft security essentials along with hitman pro and malwarebytes as scanners. All programs are free. All programs are efficient. I get no ads. My computer does not lag at all due to heavy ram consumption from the programs. The scanners only work when I want to scan so they don't work in the background. 




Many paid programs actually suffer from the problems you described. There's tons of paid programs out there and most of them lag your computer because the general public doesn't mess with the settings and the default settings are ""Real time scanning on"" and ""24 hour scanning"" meaning it runs nonstop. This might also be the problem you're facing with your ""free"" antivirus programs. If your computer is lagging then turn off realtime scanning unless you're constantly downloading from sketchy websites. 




An alternative if you want to use free programs is to upload sketchy files [here](https://www.virustotal.com/) or use malwarebytes or something similar to scan your computer once in a while. I really don't ever even use my antivirus program (which is why I just use security essentials) but I guess if you want to be extra protected for some reason sure get something. 


So does your claim stand? No. I explained my free set up which works better than paid setups. Im sorry you had a bad experience from some AV's. And again as far as I have known Norton was always a paid AV that had like a 30 day free trial. Not a free AV. ",chevybow,t1_ciijbdz,1403886039,3,t3_298jbk,2

Moral rules are not arbitrary, but are based on helping us to continue to exist and to grow. A society that saw murdering each other as moral would not long last, compared to a society that saw protecting each other as moral. An individual who does not value their own life will be more likely to lose it than one who does, so there's likely a selection process in terms of what views of morality can exist for any prolonged period of time, in an individual or in a society. 

I'd also say that if morality really is all about promoting and protecting life, then it is also (at least partially) hard-wired into us. (Almost) all living things act to protect and spread life, working to maintain their existence and to have descendants.

84904,1215_A,"Before you dismiss me as some angsty teenage atheist, please hear me out. I am actually interested in having my view changed.

First, let me give you a little background to explain why I feel the way that I do about the concept of a supernatural being, particularly those held as deities by the major world religions. I was raised in a somewhat fundamentalist Christian household, and I fully believed the majority of what I was taught until around the age of 16. Even when I would question some things, I could usually find satisfactory answers to my questions through research or by talking to a pastor, youth group leader, family member or friend. However, as I got older and was became friends with people who held world views that starkly contradicted my own, I started questioning some of the more basic concepts of my faith- not out of rebellion or disdain, but simply out of a desire to learn more. In fact, at this point I thought that it was simply God’s way of making me a stronger Christian, and that once I found the answers I was looking for I would be able to confidently explain them to anyone who asked me the same questions. However, as time went on, I continued to pray, read, and talk about the doubts I was having, but I ended up coming to the conclusion that there were irreconcilable contradictions within the Bible and within the concept of God (or at least the God of Christianity, at that point). When I stopped believing in God, it was not a decision, but simply a realization that I no longer thought that the things I had learned my entire life were completely true. 

That all happened a few years back. Since then I have had a few back-and-forth periods between trying to believe again and completely rejecting anything having to do with religion, but as I spent more time at college and had more time to think about and explore my beliefs, I have started to feel more and more that the idea of God is no more than a fairy tale to help people feel better about a world and a life that can be somewhat bleak at times. I still try to respect my family’s beliefs, because they really do try to respect mine as well, but the more time I spend apart from the church, the more I realize how silly it all sounds to me. Additionally, I have now had some time to look into other religions as well, and despite their differences (and my admittedly limited knowledge of them compared to Christianity), I find that most of them fall into the same category- fantastical stories, which are well-intentioned and (arguably) decent as moral guides, but most likely largely fictional. I acknowledge that most of the figureheads of the religions (i.e. Jesus, Muhammad, etc.) were real people, but I think they were nothing more than philosophical leaders who were deified after their deaths. 

So now that I’ve explained why I don’t believe in any god, here is what I do believe. I believe that science represents the best of our knowledge and understanding of the world. While we do not know everything, and we never will, I do not see that as a reason to fill in the gaps with supernatural explanation. As long as we continue to pursue more knowledge and advancement through the rigor of scientific experimentation and theory, we will learn as much as we can about the universe we live in, and that is good enough for me. I believe that when we die, we simply cease to exist, and as such I believe it is important to make as much out of this life as possible. I believe that any religion is a largely primitive and illogical construct created simply out of the human desire to believe that there is more to life than meets the eye, and that religion as a whole will largely disappear at some point in the future of the human race.

You could change my view by convincing me of one of a few things. (A) I have only completely rejected religion because of my fundamentalist upbringing, and a lesser form of Christianity or some other religion might fit into a logical view of the world. (B) Science and religion (specifically one of the major world religions) are not mutually exclusive, and can instead complement one another for a more complete understanding of life.
I should add that simply stating that believing in God would be a good thing will not be enough. Just because something would be nice or convenient does not mean I can force myself to believe it.

Addendum: In case anyone is wondering, the reason I want to have my view changed is simple. Where I live, most people are religious, and I feel that it would greatly help my relationship with a lot of people if I at least believed in something, even if I never return to a full belief in Christianity. Furthermore, I am currently dating a girl who is absolutely amazing and with whom I mesh perfectly in just about every other way, but she is a Christian (although not nearly as fundamentalist as my family) and has expressed some concern about my lack of faith. While she has not tried at all to push me towards changing that aspect of myself, I would hate for that to be the one thing that stands between us and long term happiness, so I’m taking the initiative. That may seem like a cheap reason to want to change my entire world view, but it is what it is- and honestly, maybe having something to believe in wouldn’t be so bad for me.

So there you have it. I may be barking up the wrong tree since I know reddit doesn’t have a whole lot of outspoken religious people, but if anyone feels up to the challenge, please Change My View.

84959,1215_A,"I'm going to disagree with your assertion that gods are just a product of our fear of death (although certain ones are, and I believe that the Christian god falls under that net).  Humans naturally seek to explain the world around us.  There's a reason that creation myths exist in every culture to explain the origins of the things around us.  We fear what we cannot know, so we try to deal with that by believing that we know it.  In the modern era, this has become less pronounced because the things we do not know have much less relation to our daily lives.  Death is the only exception, and this may be part of the reason for the surge in popularity of the three primary monotheistic religions over the past two millennia.  So, when we had a question but no basis by which to find the answer, such as the scientific method, we just found an answer that made sense.  It didn't have to be proven or demonstrated, it just had to fit with what we thought of the world.  As a story is passed down, it gains authority and can morph into more of a truth than a story.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7x-RGfd0Yk

I would like to know if there's any usage of imperial that is more practical than the metrics. So far I think that they are completely useless. The main argument is: the metric system has logical transition (100 cm = 10 dm = 1m) so it's practical in every case scenario, because if you have to calculate something, say, from inches to feet, it's pretty hard but in metrics everything has a base 10 so it's easy.",Wiplive,t3_2544cj,,,ORIGINAL_POST,5
86299,1232_B,"If at any time you need to divide your unit of length measurement into thirds, imperial shines. What's 1/3 of a meter? 3 decimeters, 3 centimeters, 3 millimeters etc etc. What's 1/3 of a yard? A foot. Period, end. What's 1/3 of a foot? 4 inches. Period, end. 

For volume it is even better, because that is a base 16 system, which goes into binary way better than base 10 could ever hope to. It's also a perfect square, which makes it really easy when you're dealing with halves, quarters, eighths, sixteenths, etc. ",Mavericgamer,t1_chdif8t,1399631554,145,t3_2544cj,5

But the metrics does 2, so they are good for dividing into all even numbers, but diving in 3 it does well only in 3;6;9;12 and so on.

What about the bigger length measurement. 1 mile = 1760 yards. 1760 doesn't divide into 3. So what's the logic behind that? (Sorry if I sound too biased, I just like maths :D)",Wiplive,t1_chdijjo,1399632336,40,t1_chdif8t,5
86336,1232_B,"I don't understand miles, but I also find that I rarely have to express something that is typically measured in miles in anything other than miles, except as a novelty.

Also, imperial does 2 as well; it has trouble with 5, which is the advantage metric has, and 10 is an outlier, which is again a bit problematic. Everything ever has a problem dividing by 7. Fuck 7. That aside, when you get below an inch, the default method is to start dividing by 2. Half-inch, quarter-inch, eighth-inch, etc. Even smaller if you start going for really precise measurements. These naturally get made binary, perfect squares, etc;

The real problem with all of this is that the numbers and units of measurement are meaningless outside of a frame of reference; I don't have a good concept for how big an acre is. I know that it's about 1/8 of a square mile, but I don't have a good concept for how big a square mile is. A while ago, I read that something like 2,000 acres of a city was flooded. I had no idea what 2,000 acres looked like, but I needed to know because I had to answer the question of how much of that city was under water. And I wouldn't have known any better if they had said that it was 2,000 square kilometers (I don't know the conversion and I'm too lazy). So in that regard, both measurements are equally useless at conveying information.

Now, go to America; we are raised with feet and yards, we know them somewhat instinctively. We know that a football field is about 100 yards long, so if we see a field that looks roughly as long as 3 football fields, we can say that we have about 300 yards. We have none of that for metric; I couldn't tell you anything in my life that is a meter long, I only know that a meter is roughly a yard. And that is why conversion is difficult.",Mavericgamer,t1_chdiwwz,1399634693,49,t1_chdijjo,5

This is really shaky ground. Small children don't understand death, for example.

What's way more important is that the animal understands life! They form relationships and love other animals. They find pleasure and have activities they enjoy.

Right, but having done something forever is not a good reason to keep doing it. See also: dying of preventable disease, rape, murder, infanticide, theft, intestinal parasites, lice ...

&gt; They don't understand anything they do, they do them because it's been engraved in the them, by evolution.

Your capacity to learn, feel pleasure and to reason has been ""engraved"" by the same process.

What's more, animals can reason. They can figure out how to get food or shade or water or help their babies. All animals have the capacity to learn, and problem solve. They know that they want water because they are thirsty. Does it really matter that they understand that thirst means that they have lost water and need to drink so that they don't dehydrate? Not really. 

It's true that have a much more developed capacity to reason - or more accurately the capacity to reason more abstractly. But losing it wouldn't mean that we'd become expendable. People whose cognitive function is limited still have fulfilling lives and form relationships and still enjoy food and games and other pleasures and enjoy (thankfully!) rights and legal protections.

&gt; If you can't understand what life and death is, then it doesn't mean anything to you. And I'm not stealing it's life, it just doesn't make a difference, which means I can't steal destroy that meaning, when there Is none.

Does the cow not understand pleasure? If she is munching on her favorite food and you took it away would she not understand that? If she wants to be grazing in a field, but you herd her into a small pen does she not understand that she is trapped and lost the freedom?

When she bonds to her calf, and someone takes the calf away - she grieves. She may not understand why she had the calf or why she loves him, but she surely understands that she wants him back. 

So if cows understand when we take things from them, and can get upset over each comparatively small thing - how can you say that taking everything from them by killing them at 1/10th their natural life isn't taking anything from them? 

Would you say the same about a human who had an especially deluded view of what happens after you die?",llieaay,t1_ch6npv3,1398924507,1,t1_ch6ne36,4

The leaflet was surprisingly aesthetic (as shallow and manipulative literature goes, which exists all over the political spectrum) and it took till a while into the text to see any *egregious* bullshit in it.

What I did see was a metaphor implying that having sex impairs your ability to form attachments to anyone and after a breakup you need to wait a few years. At the bottom of the paragraph it turned out they were for waiting until marriage.

So, CMV, and internet at large, I'm just curious whether there's anyone at all who doesn't hold the sex-negative positions typical of the Christian right and is anything but pro-choice.

105429,1502_B,"The current system (at least in Ontario, Canada) calls for a fine not to exceed some predetermined value, and grants both prosecutors and judges discretion to reduce that amount based on the individual circumstances of the offender, both with respect to the nature of the offence, and the offender's ability to pay.

Thus, if a CEO in his BMW is caught driving 28 km/h over the limit, he is likely to pay the maximum fine of $295. If he was rushing to visit his dying mother, that fine should be reduced. And if he was rushing his dying mother to the hospital, that fine should be eliminated.

Similarly, if an unemployed single mother was caught going the same speed in her 2002 VW Golf, she should get a reduced sentence. Unfortunately in practice, she often doesn't have the ability or means to pursue that reduced sentence, but the constructs of the legal system do nonetheless technically currently provide it for her.

All this being said--I do still want to change your view. The key provision of a just enforcement system that you've missed is the nature of a maximum fine. If all men are created equal, and even where the law disciplines from each according to his means, there is still some value at which the perceived debt to society is paid, regardless of that man's wealth. Surely, we can't expect a billionaire to pay a multi-million dollar fine for a minor offense, simply because he has had the opportunity to gather wealth?

A related threat to your proposed system is the concept of a minimum fine. Such fines disproportionately affect the poor, which in turn disproportionately benefits the rich. Just as it's not fair to fine a wealthy man millions for a trivial offense, it's also not fair to take away the discretion of police, prosecutors, and judges to reduce sentences for those upon whom they would cause undue hardship.

TL;DR: A truly fair system provides reasonable case-by-case flexibility that considers ability to pay, circumstances of offense, and harm done to society.

The kind you breathe in using an E-Cig is about appreciable to the amount you take in one breath on a really foggy day. Any water that ends up in our lungs this way is quickly absorbed into the blood and tissues in our lungs, making our lungs healthy and effective. An unhealthy buildup of fluid in the lungs, like Pneumonia, would require concentrations of water vapor far exceeding that of the densest steam room (by a magnitude if not two). Our lungs are evolved and equipped to deal with water vapor, and the small amount from E-Cigs causes no lasting harm. 

But what about the chemical additives? The active ingredient is among the most common in both. Nicotine. It, on its own, is a mild carcinogen that has been show to reduce bone health. So on that alone, eCigs aren't completely safe. But cigarettes have a whole laundry list of other chemicals in them from Benzene to Formaldehyde to Ammonia to Tar. These are the true dangerous chemical in cigarettes, the ones that cause your lungs to turn black and shrivel and die. The problem I have with the anti-smoking lobby is that they lumped all of it in together as one dangerous mess, and pure tobacco is a lot less dangerous than cigarettes (though there is still some tar, etc.). 

eCigs have some of these same chemicals, but the ones that remain are no different than the ones you find eating pre-packaged food or drinking soda. They are food additives that ensure the product has a shelf-life and is able to be aerosolized. 

eCigs aren't **completely** safe. But they are a damn sight safer than traditional cigarettes.

113680,1624_A,"Government of the people, by the people, and for the people is the core concept that underpins our democracy. The basic unit of a democratic system is the individual, and power and authority gets bestowed from the bottom up. That ideal, despite being enshrined in our founding documents as 'all men are created equal', has yet to be fully met. The expansion of voting rights to groups that had not been originally included in 'all men' does show, however, that the principle stands, and that women and black people do count as parts of 'all men', and that denying them the vote is to deny them their most important role as a citizen of a democracy. To deny someone the vote is to deny their right to be governed legitimately.


We still disenfranchise citizens. Convicted felons, in some states, lose their right to vote. Convicts serving their time are not allowed to vote. Young people under 18 are not allowed to vote. And every day here on CMV someone or another is making a call to restrict voting to those who 'deserve' the right.


Voting in a democracy is not a right that gets bestowed by authority on the individual. Individuals voting is what grants that authority in the first place. If the right to vote gets denied to anyone? Then authority is no longer legitimate for that person. If we deny voting rights to some peope, but grant them to others? Then we have effectively turned upside-down the concept of authority coming from the bottom up, and grant those who retain their voting rights authority over those who haven't. Equal protection under the law is erased. The individual is rendered subservient to authority, and a two-level citizenry is created. Voting is what grants us ownership of our government, and establishes its legitimacy.


Singling out any individual or group as 'undeserving' of participating in democracy entirely misses the point. Convicted felons should get to vote, not because they deserve anything, but because the power to lock them away for their crimes is wielded by an institution that derives it's authority from the bottom up democratically. Denying felons the vote gives power to people who would undermine democracy. It sets a dangerous precedent, and establishes the notion that ownership of democratic authority can be turned on its head, and the institution can claim ownership over individuals.


Seventeen year-olds are also denied ownership of their government. That strikes me as unnecessarily conservative. Why have any voting age? If you accept that voting isn't a right that gets bestowed from above, but that instead that allowing ALL citizens to vote is what grants government authority to govern all citizens?

While the principle is solid, I think you run into issues of practicality when you start talking about literally giving newborn infants the right to cast a vote.  As others have said, children basically do whatever they're told, and in the case of voting, that has serious consequences.  We start literally handing out votes as a reward for having more children.  What you're essentially saying, since we know this to be the case, is that people with more kids (or kids at all) get to have more say in how things are run in this country, which actually runs totally contrary to the principle of ""one person, one vote"", because now it becomes ""one person, 5 votes"" if you can pop out five kids.

I would agree that the voting age should be lowered, however, to something more like 13 or 14.  By that age, we are expected to start contributing to society, and treated as adults in the eyes of the legal system.  At that point, you can divorce your parents, you can be tried as an adult, etc.  So I would agree that 18 is too old to allow someone to start voting.

That being said, it seems like anything pretty much any company does, besides Valve, is immediately dismissed as a shameless cash-grab. The concept of turning a profit or increasing revenue is often considered morally wrong or downright evil.

The attitude towards piracy is a good example: whenever a company attempts to protect the product that they spent time and resources on from being stolen, it's viewed as proof of their greed. I think this is completely unreasonable. A company has the right and often the need to protect their product. Even if it costs nothing for someone else to download it, the software required a significant amount of money and effort to produce and bring to market. Except in a few extreme circumstances, efforts by companies to curtail piracy are totally reasonable.

118505,1708_B,"&gt; To summarize, I think the idea that ""turning a profit"" and companies in general are evil is unreasonable.

I don't think this is what redditors actually believe though. 

I'm going to start by saying I dislike CMVs in this format. It's hard, sometimes borderline impossible, to reasonably demonstrate that people in group X believe thing Y. It's not really a falsifiable position to hold because all evidence for and against is going to be purely anecdotal. It'd be better to argue for or against specific beliefs.

Since you provided examples of specific beliefs, I can address those, but the underlying attitude problem is a much harder issue to deal with. 

&gt; The attitude towards piracy is a good example

Full disclosure, I am a game programmer. None of the games I've worked on have DRM of any kind (In fact they're all free to play, so doing so would be dumb anyway :P)

The reason people don't like anti-piracy efforts is because they are shortsighted, ineffective, and chiefly harm legitimate users. If I go to the store and buy a LEGO set, that LEGO set is *mine*. I don't need to ask permission to use it. I don't need to give the LEGO company a call when I want to put it together. They don't (and shouldn't) have any say over how I use my property. Once I've paid for it, it's mine. That's the way software should generally work too. Once I buy it, it's mine and the creator should not interfere with my ability to use it. If they have problems with keeping people from stealing it, that's their problem, not mine. If their authorization servers go down, suddenly I can't use the product I paid for that I own, and now I'm the one suffering because of *their* problem. 

The people who pirate the software actually get the better deal here. They a superior version of the software. It won't be crippled when it can't be authorized. Companies can't send it a message telling it to shut down or cease working. The people stealing the software are the ones *not affected* by the antipiracy efforts. The only people antipiracy code affects are the ones who are legitimate paying users. 

Trying to stop people form stealing your software via DRM (and other methods) is a natural, knee jerk reaction to the problem, but it's not one that prioritizes the customers' experience, nor is it even effective.

Many companies have even realized that it's a good idea to give out software licenses for free (or very cheap). Students can get Photoshop super super cheap (or maybe free? I'm not sure) because Adobe realized that a large number of the people pirating it were students, and if they can get those people using their software when they're younger then they will almost certainly use it professionally when they're older. Rather than punish people who wanted to use it for cheap, they found a way to make it work for them to their benefit. 

&gt; Another notion that seems common on reddit is that corporations are evil who only want money and never did anything good for anyone. 

Again, this sort of goes back to my point about beliefs that are hard to falsify. If there are specific instances where you think that people were being unreasonably harsh toward the practices of a given business, that would be a more concrete discussion. 

&gt; Tech companies make life easier

And sometimes they have shady practices with respect to private data and such that make them hard to trust, but without an example there's nothing really to argue.

&gt; agribusiness helps feed an enormous and growing population

...while sometimes abusing the legal system and patents in anticompetitive ways

&gt; and healthcare, while grossly overpriced, provides better treatment options than at any time in history.

...and in the process bankrupts people ruining what life they have left.

This was a good response, and it made me think a little bit more about the rights of the consumer once they've purchased the product, but I think the lego argument is flawed for a couple of reasons. For starters, preventing theft of a physical packaged product is a much easier thing to do. Someone taking that product has to do so in public with a significant risk of being caught and prosecuted. It is also generally accepted to be morally wrong to steal something like that.

With software, you can do it from home without serious risk of repercussion, and it generally isn't even frowned upon by a large segment of the population. Just because the software can be replicated free of charge does not mean that taking it without paying has no negative impact on the business. As a result, theft is easier and more problematic for software companies, so they tend to resort to more extreme measures.

That being said, you did a good job of explaining why it angers legitimate customers. ",Zoidinho,t1_cf4go9d,1391275577,6,t1_cf4fnk7,3
122275,1752_A,"Last year's Oscar winner in cinematography was *Life of Pi*.  This year's favorite darling is *Gravity*.  These films **do** have stunning cinematography; I am not questioning that.  However, the cinematography has become so completely digitized that comparing a *Life of Pi* to something like *Skyfall* is doing a great disservice to ""classic"" cinematography.  The two types should be divorced from one another and have separate categories for which to judge them.

Namely: when you digitize your cinematography, you nearly have an infinite number of possibilities.  The only limit is your imagination and the budget on your effects department.  Yet when you talk about classic (""analog""?) cinematography, you have a lot more constraints.  You need to operate in real world, dealing with variables encountered in a real world.  A cinematographer needs to account for these variables in a way that requires a different vision than digital cinematography does.  Similarly, we don't lump animated films into the best picture category because the challenges associated with them are distinctly different than the challenges associated with ""regular"" films.  This isn't to disparage the digitization, mind you, just simply a recognition of the different skill set required to pull it off.  

I envision two main counterarguments forthcoming, so I'll address them here:

* The realm of digital cinematography is not expansive enough presently.  If it were to become its own category, there might only be one, maybe two, nominees.  This could be true, but it only makes the concern delayed rather than eradicated.  The future will likely see more and more digital works which could sustain a healthy pool of contenders vying for the title.

* Digitization is an evolution of cinematography, not a revolution, and the creeping influence of it is witnessed even in the so-called ""classic"" cases (for instance, I referenced *Skyfall* earlier which surely isn't **entirely** classical in the sense *Shawshank* is).  Essentially: the line between ""digital"" and ""classic"" is hard to distinguish.  I actually don't think this matters that much.  All of these sorts of awards are subjective enough that you don't need an objective way of determining whether a film fits into the ""digital"" or ""classic"" cinematography bubble because the way of choosing the winner therein is not objective, yet there can likely be a general consensus found on whether a certain film would be considered for ""digital"" or ""classic"" cinematography.",MooseAtWork,t3_1vga02,,,ORIGINAL_POST,3
122285,1752_A,"This argument comes up with every significant advancement in the technology surrounding the making of art, as if people somehow believe that the tools create the work, not the artist/cinematographer/painter/etc.

Photographers were reviled by painters, digital photographers reviled by film photographers, photoshoppers reviled by ""pure digital photographers,"" and so on and so forth.

A cinematographer's job is to make a beautiful image. The tools and technology available to him/her have changed significantly since the foundation of the art, but the end goal has remained static: create visuals that artfully portray the theme and action of the screenplay being filmed. A great ""digital"" cinematographer has the same eye as a great ""classic"" cinematographer, and they're using the same basic tools to do the job--lighting, camera movement, focus, framing/composition, etc. What difference does it make if they're composing the image inside of a 3D toolset or the ""real"" world?

I'm not ""reviling"" digital cinematography at all.  However, I am recognizing the two are very different beasts in the skill it takes to execute either and, in recognition of that, they need to be judged separately.  You're right, the same general qualities are needed, but that doesn't mean they're comparable.  For instance, a photographer and a painter require some of the same skill sets to create their art (knowledge of lighting, composition, space, etc.), yet there are some skills which are unique to each (e.g. a photographer doesn't care about the consequences of certain kinds of brushstrokes just as a painter doesn't care about certain kinds of lenses) that make it impossible to compare.  For instance, I don't make a value judgment and say I like X painting more than Y photograph because they're simply different media, even if they both essentially exist as two-dimensional, ""stationary"" art.",MooseAtWork,t1_ces5dj5,1389989821,1,t1_ces50fs,3
122838,1768_B,"So, from my limited understanding of this, I've read that PTSD and Depression (just two examples) are reaching [ridiculous levels](http://www.prweb.com/releases/2013/10/prweb11195568.htm) [of diagnosis.](http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=Depression&amp;Template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=88939) It would seem that coming back from the events of war causes significant changes in one's mental state, and that transitioning back to society is extremely difficult, even for the soldiers who are 'fine.'

Now, we know a lot of ways to [combat PTSD](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/post_traumatic_stress_disorder_symptoms_treatment.htm) [and depression](http://www.helpguide.org/mental/depression_tips.htm), and [there's new studies coming out all the time, so it's clearly something we as a society care about](http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html).

It just seems to me that generally, American society continually spouts the whole, ""I support the troops"" mindset, but what does that really mean? The biggest problems that face troops don't have to do with supplies, funding, or a lack of training going into the conflict, but their transition back into society afterwards. We train them to go *into* the conflict, why would we not train them to *come out* of it?

If we **know** that many, many troops struggle with this, and we **know** how to treat it (obviously each case is different, but I mean as an overarching topic we do know treatment methods), it seems like a no brain-er that we should be doing something about it. In my mind, the best way to do this would be to have some sort of mandatory program for soldiers when they return. It could be just a month or two long (after which those soldiers who still need help will at least have the resources readily available to them), and it would consist of living and working as a group to achieve peaceful goals, possibly [raising animals](http://www.helpguide.org/life/pets.htm), [spending a lot of time outside](http://depts.washington.edu/hhwb/Thm_Mental.html), etc etc. Even for those soldiers who aren't suffering from these serious issues would benefit from some down time to reduce stress levels and transition back into everyday life.

**EDIT: /u/groovyoctopus suggested possibly doing volunteer work, I thought it was worth mentioning up here as well so new readers could see it.**

The money for all of this, in the perfect world, would come from all the excess military spending that this country pumps out (if you don't believe that, just [Google excess military spending](http://lmgtfy.com/?q=excess+military+spending) and see what comes up).

One final supporting point is that [over half of all enlisted forces are between the ages of 18-30](http://www.statisticbrain.com/demographics-of-active-duty-u-s-military/). This means that most people who are enlisted are still relatively young, and have not spent a lot of time off in the real world on their own. So another argument is that since they have not spent a lot of time interacting with society as a regular citizen, then they have very little to 'fall back' on in terms of old habits or old feelings to relate to.

So that's the thinking behind my view. I'm really interested in reading some arguments as to why we **don't** already do this.

Thanks everyone!

P.S. I understand that funding might be the biggest issue people are going to raise. I would prefer to hear other arguments against this, because funding is the most apparent/easiest one to spot, but also the easiest one to refute.

P.P.S. This whole topic was sparked in my mind over this recent [This American Life story](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/515/transcript) (skip to ""Deep, Dark, Open Secret"").

EDIT: I've already clarified in comments below, so instead of posting the same thing to each reply, the program would definitely provide ample time to spend with family and friends. I think that the program could be structured in such a way that veterans could commute to the camp in order to preform tasks, much like a 9-5 job. It would not necessitate being away from their families for another month or two after the end of deployment.

EDIT #2: Also, the details of the program aren't what matters so much about my post. If you have suggestions about what soldiers could be doing during this reverse boot camp time, I'd gladly hear them. However, my view isn't so much about *what* they should be doing to re-integrate, but the fact that they should be doing *something*, and that *something* should be organized and paid for by the military that put them in a combat zone.

EDIT #3: For anyone who want's to say that we already have programs in place (like individual counseling, etc), I am aware of that, and that is a valid point. However, before you post it, I'd like you to take a look at [veteran suicide rates](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2013/01/14/169364733/u-s-militarys-suicide-rate-surpassed-combat-deaths-in-2012), or just google it if you don't like that article. They're out of control. So it would appear that the system we have in place isn't working. If you have evidence to refute that, I'd love to read up on it.

**EDIT #4: It has been brought to my attention that re-integration programs do exist in each branch of the military (I guess someone thought this was a good idea before!).

A reverse boot camp as you describe, still does not instill the individualization and self agency an returning vet needs to reintegrate.  Moreover, this reverse boot camp is unlikely to act in the individual's best interest as it is still part of the military.  

Rather than reconciling the individual's wartime actions with societal norms (a large source of anxiety for returning vets), I can see this program glossing it over as a necessary evil, pushing the blame on America's enemies.

And again you completely avoid the point. assault with a deadly weapon is just as much a victimless crime if you dont actually shoot somebody as driving drunk, but somehow thats a permissible law.

1. Christians who are against homosexuality don't hate homosexuals per se; they hate homosexual acts (ie hate the sin, no the sinner). Even among rabid homophobic sects and denominations, celibate/virgin homosexuals are often compared with kleptomaniacs who resist the urge to steal. In other words, they are lauded for resisting their ungodly urges. So already, a homosexual Christian isn't incompatible. They just have to be celibate.

2. On a more theological level, everyone is supposed to be have sinned in the eyes of God. Everyone falls short in the eyes of God. And depending on the denomination, the ""everyone falling short"" part technically condemns everyone to hell. You're going to Hell for being gay, and you're going to Hell for being an asshole to people, and you're going to Hell for drinking too much, etc. That's basically the whole point of Jesus's crucifixion as espoused by Christians. His death is supposed to wash away the presence of sin or otherwise give Christian a fighting chance to enter Heaven. This is also why evangelicalism is a huge deal for Christians because the whole ""Jesus washing away your Hell damning sins"" only works if you actually believe in Jesus. Homosexual acts would just be another form of sin.

3. Your edit of ""the laws of Christianity"" doesn't really make sense. There isn't a agreed upon ""law of Christianity."" Christians don't agree with the version of Bible to use (KJV vs NIV). Depending on the denomination, there's sections of the Bible that gets replaced (The Catholic Bible has sections that's not found in the Protestant Bible and vice versa). And what about Mormons? They use the Old Testament and New Testament like most Christian denominations, but they also use an additional book called the Book of Mormon. So, does that mean they aren't Christian because they use an additional book?

4. Another objection I have with your post is that religion isn't just ""stuff that we have to follow because it's written in this holy book."" This is a fair point to mistaken as Protestants tend to focus on the Bible over other things like tradition, and most American Christians are Protestants, which means most American non-Christians are mostly exposed to Protestant Christianity (I'm assuming you're American). But this isn't necessarily true for all Christian denominations. Catholics stress tradition as well as the Bible. That's why Catholics have all these holidays celebrating saints and why Catholics venerate saints even though saints aren't referenced in the Bible at all. Religion exists among illiterate tribes of people, so a canon isn't a necessary condition for a religion. So, what are the traditions of the various Christian denominations?

To be clear, I said you have a tenuous grasp of Christianity *as practiced by actual Christians.*

1. My 1st point isn't compatible with your post because your post, in line with progressive views of sexuality, assumes the existence of a sexual orientation (in this case, homosexuality) and conceptualizes the homophobia among many Christians as people butthurt over a deviant sexual orientation while my point is that those Christians object over sexual acts, not an explicit sexual orientation. I don't think those Christians even believe in the existence of a sexual orientation as conceptualized by modern gender studies. That's why you have stuff like ""pray the gay away."" To them, homosexuals are like addicts addicted to drugs, and it's all a matter of praying to God and ""willpower"" for you to stop shooting heroin or having homosexual sex. This flies in the face of evidence from human biology that homosexuality is an innate trait someone is born with.

2. Eh, perhaps I'm not explaining myself as clearly as I would've liked. I guess my point is that there's nothing inherently self-contradictory of a Christian sinning. Every Christian is more or less in agreement that the only sinless individual who has ever lived is Jesus. The question is over repentance and what consitutes repentance. ""What constitutes repentance?"" is a question that entire wars had been fought over and continues to be endlessly debated among Christians of different sects. Suffice to say, there's nothing close to a consensus among Christians. ""What is repentance?"" is also a question that gets debated. From what I've read, most definitions of repentance has a condition that you are aware that you've sinned. You can't repent if you don't know that you've sinned. So what does ""awareness of sin"" mean? This question is also debated. I've read stuff ranging from ""you know you've sinned because God said so in the Bible"" to ""even in a godless environment, people are still aware of sin because God has build in a sin-o-meter in everyone that starts beeping when they sin"" to ""it is impossible to sin unless you are completely aware that your act defies God, you believe your act defies God, and you chose to defy God anyways."" Christian theology, like most theology of other religions, is messy once you get into the details and try to recouncil multiple sects.

That out of the way, I can see you're more interested in hearing about Biblical interpretations that justify homosexuality. While I fall in the camp of Christianity that doesn't believe the Bible is infallible, I have grown up in an environment where all the Christians around me do. The argument in favor of both Biblical inerrancy and homosexuality is that the verses that condemn it are misinterpreted:

The Old Testament verses in Leviticus that are often cited could be argued to be in the same camp as the laws about not eating pork and shellfish: Jesus came and established a New Covenant which basically threw out the strict legalism of the Old Testament, with all of its highly specific laws and procedures.

The New Testament references in Paul's letters don't actually use a word that specifically means ""homosexual"". The word he uses is better translated (and in some translations is) as ""sexual deviants"", which is unspecific about to whom it refers. Some people take this to mean everything from oral sex to beastiality. It's not clear what Paul was specifically referring to. While one could still argue that this includes homosexuality, if one did not believe homosexuality to be deviancy (like most Christians are fine with oral sex despite some claiming it to be deviant), then these verses do not condemn homosexuality.

My personal belief on the matter is a bit less sure. I am open to the possibility that homosexuality is a sin, but I believe that if Jesus met a homosexual man he would show him nothing but love and understanding. Whether someone is homosexual or not does not affect the way I see them or treat them, and I believe that it shouldn't. I don't know if it's a sin or not-- I don't think we can know for sure, since the verses are so vague, but I find it hard to believe that the same loving God who we say embodies love would condemn real love in any form. And unless I were homosexual or someday had a child who was homosexual, I don't feel like it's important for me to be sure one way or the other.

The short of it is, Christianity is about loving each other, loving God, and believing in the sacrifice of Jesus. That's the heart of it, and if you believe that you are absolutely a Christian, no matter what your sexual orientation. All the other things are rules, many of which I believe were made by men who thought they correctly interpreted God's intentions.

133388,1901_B,"Gandhi single handedly(yes and I'll double down on it) shaped the nature of Indian Independence movement.

In order to understand Gandhi's real historical effect, you must read his work(he wrote a lot, his complete works can be published in 40 volumes). Lemme capture this complicated topic in bullet points.

* Gandhi's most fundamental idea was that to achieve right ~~means~~ ends, we must use right ~~ends~~ means. Liberty and peace being right and noble ends, require that we use peaceful means to achieve them. A violent action to achieve his means was very heavily opposed by Gandhi.

* Gandhi suspended one of the most successful movements in India against the british called [Non-cooperation movement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-cooperation_movement)(launched in response to [Jaliahwalah Bagh Massacre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jallianwala_Bagh_massacre) in which 1300 people died), purely because in one small town of India a bunch of protesters torched a whole police station killing 22 police officers.

* This action disappointed numerous people but it gave a very clear message to people all across India. Those who wanted to join him into the struggle, the message was clear regarding the importance of ""means"" to achieve the ends. Violent mean will not be acceptable to achieve independence. Immortalized in the movie 'Gandhi' through the quote ""...for this cause I am willing to die too, but there's no cause for which I am willing to kill..."" [link](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3tjIiWIkAQ)

* To understand the message sent to the common Indian man, you must understand how things were back then. Unlike the impression you get today, people born in that time had always known living under the british rule as a fact of life. Not many people thought that they were to greatly benefit from the removal of the British Rule(not that they supported it greatly, they just didn't think the effort was going to be worth it). 
  
  By waging a completely non-violent movement, Gandhi exposed the true face of British rule. You couldn't lie to yourself anymore that everything is working fine. I will give you an example. In America recently it was revealed that NSA is spying on Americans on a massive scale. Every piece of information can be and usually is, stored by the government. What is the outcome of such a revelation? Sure people are talking about it, but the most, it has become a cultural meme in the society. People crack wise joke about NSA listening on them and everybody laughs. I mean NSA revelations show that the foundations for a future dystopian society has been laid upon already, but nobody cares because it hasn't really been used for anything real evil.

  Nobody faces the reality of being unfree, until it really flies into their face. Germans in Nazi germany always [thought that they were free](http://www.amazon.com/They-Thought-Were-Free-Germans/dp/0226511928).

  By being a person who was more peaceful and non-violent than the most nonchalant and aloof of the Indians, he exposed the righteousness of the British government, something violent revolutionaries cannot do. When violent revolutionaries go against the aggressors, most people do not wanna be the person getting shot. Most of the time, they wait it out or support it from outside. Satyagraha on the other hand was different. Kids, women, old people, young men, everybody was taking part in it.

* To the ruling British, it was a major point of Gandhi(and you'd know if you read him) that they must understand that he is all for law, order, and peace with British, that he did not hold any kind of animosity against them. All they had to do is to step away. Because of this effect you think that Gandhi merely pandered to the ruling elites. The violent revolutionaries merely wanted to use violence against the British until they left. 
  
  In fact lemme ask you this question, have you ever wondered how come so many Indian and British soldiers under General Dyer were willing to shoot hundreds of innocent people in Jalianwalah Bagh Massacre? What made them do this? The answer isn't found in Indian history books, but when you dig deeper into the coming events of the JWB Massacre, you'll find that Amritsar was becoming increasingly hostile and violent against the British soldiers. The locals had started to threaten and harass the wives and kids of the British officers. This is why it didn't take much for General Dyer's order to be followed. The soldiers who did this atrocity considered themselves as having their back against the wall.

* Gandhi on the other hand was using a much clever tactic. He ensured that the British felt really safe. A feeling of safety takes away any incentive or motivation to commit violence. Had British felt uncomfortable by the Indian Independence movement, they'd have committed numerous other violent atrocities, they committed in the rest of the world.

* Just because Indian government pushes Gandhi on you almost like a saint or a deity and you feel getting annoyed by it, that does not mean that his contribution is any less valid.

* A lot of people think that Gandhi got lucky with British because the Brits were more noble than other Imperialist powers. The fact is that the British weren't different, Gandhi was different. He used British values against them. If he was against the Nazis, he would have used the German values and greatness against them. 

* Finally I am going to repeat the argument again. Indian government and most people do not understand Gandhi or his accomplishments. I mean throwing people in prison for publishing books criticizing him? WTF! Anna Hazare who calls himself a Gandhian used to tie alcoholics on to trees for drinking alcohol in the name of Gandhi. Anna Hazare's Lokpal movement will and has also failed because he does not understand what Gandhi managed to do or how he did it.

Instead of being a great bastion of starting something new in the history of mankind(i.e. action through non-violence) our society has fallen back into the comfortable mirths of violence, and now we don't even think that he actually did anything.

133398,1901_B,"OK, firstly, woahh! That is a lot of stuff you have written!

That is one point I totally agree with, that Gandhi took away the aggressor's motivation for violence, and made him look like a jackass if he persisted.

The Jalianwalah Baug motivation was not known to me from this POV, that is a revelation, thank you.

I respect Gandhi, I have total respect for what he did and what he stands for. No one will deny what he has done. Satyaghara can still be a powerful tool, and it will always be his invention. My point is how he is manipulated into something perfect, without flaw, and how day by day, and tolerance to creative criticism is vanishing from India, and the face of the earth in general. Others too contributed to a large extent in creating the atmosphere necessary for a revolt against the Brits. Other's too festered a sense of pride and an urge towards freedom, and the realization of alienness of the British Raj in India. Nathuram Godse erred by killing Gandhi out of desperation, but it shows how a large section of society back then were unhappy with the whims with which he was directing the freshly freed country politics.

Gandhi gave a means, a successful one at that, but others contributed by involving even the violent sections of society into the freedom struggle. Momentum needs contribution from everyone. Gandhi seemed like he would have settled down for something lesser than complete freedom for India. It was because of popularity of the extremists that the Gandhi-Nehrus took the cause of complete freedom seriously. Savarkar wrote instigating poetry and essays which shook the intellectual class. Bhagat Singh took to the pen as well as the sword, Tilak brought communities together under the garb of cultural celebrations. Marathi, Gujarathi, Hindi Playwriters wrote plays modifying the Mahabharata to depict India-British relations and showing a revolution as means to freedom. These acheivements too need to be acknowledged, while at the same time, Gandhi's hidden sides also be made 'de-classified' so that people can learn history rather than mythology.

Gandhi has repeatedly said, he has no intention in embarrassing or insulting the aggressor. He just politely wants aggressor to show his true nature by willing to go through all the violence the aggressor would inflict upon him.

&gt;  My point is how he is manipulated into something perfect, without flaw, and how day by day, and tolerance to creative criticism is vanishing from India, and the face of the earth in general.

Haha you don't have to tell me about it, I [gave a speech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mPcOAjZUA5Y#t=1575) on this topic where I preached Gandhian method to my fellow Libertarians. I grew up hating Gandhi because of the crap they teach to us about him.

The problem is, not many people(including the one pushing his ideas on us) understand what Gandhi managed to do, or how his ideas worked. Government thinks ""Well its better of these people learn Gandhian methods to deal with us, instead of using violence"". The fact is, government gains its power through violence. 

Imagine how the reactions of Americans would have been if Al Queda had used Gandhian methods in New York to make their point. Most Americans would be forced to think why they did this. But because they chose violence, Americans didn't have to think about it. Massive violent reaction took place and Al Queda has been wiped off. In fact I can't really say for certain that Al Queda had a real just goal behind their actions, because its impossible to see through the light the violent bloodshed of 9/11.

&gt; Nathuram Godse erred by killing Gandhi out of desperation, but it shows how a large section of society back then were unhappy with the whims with which he was directing the freshly freed country politics.

This is where I believe Gandhi failed. Yes he knew that he had to liberate the country from the British, but he failed to full comprehend the idea behind liberty and 'swaraj'. He stopped at removing the foreigners out, but not about dismantling the power structure. So the moment 'goras' left, new people jumped in, and with massive support from the rest of the people. In a more consistent application of Gandhian principles I am a libertarian.

&gt; Gandhi seemed like he would have settled down for something lesser than complete freedom for India. It was because of popularity of the extremists that the Gandhi-Nehrus took the cause of complete freedom seriously. 

Everybody until [Purna Swaraj](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purna_Swaraj) movement would have settled down for anything less than complete freedom for India. But yes, he did not desire it initially. But here reading his work gives you an insight into his psyche.

The whole tactic of Gandhi relied upon demanding little and reasonable stuff and having it rejected. He talks a lot about how its important to get the timing right. The people must be ready. He got this wrong a bunch of times(esp. non-cooperation movement and Chauri Chuara) where he believed that people weren't ready.

The most amusing thing I realized while reading Gandhi was that he treats non-violence precisely like how we would expect Mr Miyagi(from Karate Kid) to treat Martial Arts and how a military commander would treat his army.

BUT at the same time, most of us just think that all we need to do for Satyagraha to be successful is to go out there and show the aggressor that you can take all of his aggression.

And yes, I get your emotions, I never doubt Gandhi's contributions, albeit they are overrated today at the cost of contributions of others, to a point that I, a person with moderate interest in Indian history, stand guilty of missing out many prominent names simply because I can't remember them naturally this instant. This is what has happened as a consequence of my regular curriculum course. What I do remember though, are silly stories of Gandhi and Nehru which sound really glittery, but ended up hammering unneeded divinity into my mind as a child.

College is supposed to train you for the real world and provide useful relative skills and a timed test is not one of them.

This isn't a result of a degree though. It's a result of personal discipline and a general willingness to want to perform well as a person.

Yes, but with proper time management you can accommodate aspects of your job that you're slow at by leveraging more time to complete them and against aspects of the job you are faster at. if the job is done and done well by the deadline, your personal struggles are a mostly moot point in the work place.

141169,2004_A,"On paper, it might sound good to have a free game that draws you in and gives you perks for monetary donations if you like what you see. But in practice, it completely changes a video game into a psychologically aggressive environment which is always reminding you what you're not getting if you don't pay real money. These games are essentially built to bully you out of your money and give nothing back of any value.

This goes double for ""pay to win"" games, but also applies when it's only ascetic. 

Someone once told me an excellent analogy. Pretend you're shopping at a department store and you find some awesome clothes that are ridiculously cheap, so you decide to buy them. But when you get to the checkout counter, you find out that you're not allowed to take the clothes out of the store. While they're ""yours"", you can only own them within the confines of the store. So you find yourself coming back to the store everyday because you really want to wear those awesome clothes you purchased. So while you're walking around the store wearing your awesome clothes, you have lots of time to see everything else that's on sale until you're tempted to buy more. Also, other shoppers will see you wearing your awesome clothes and be jealous of you, and want to buy those clothes for themselves. So in the end, the act of purchasing your clothes gave you nothing of value (because let's be honest, you never actually owned anything), and only enabled the store to further advertize to you and indirectly to your friends. It's like the store didn't even sell anything, but still wanted your money and used empty promises and peer pressure to get it out of you. In short, a scam.

Another good analogy is that paying for stuff in a F2P game is like creating a horcrux. It doesn't have any actual value on its own; you give it value by paying for something, which is like putting part of your soul into the game that you can't take back out. Once you do it, you find it hard to separate yourself from the game without feeling like you've lost something important. You get emotionally invested and you can't let it go, even though the only real value in the game is the artificial value you gave it by depositing your money into it. From there, it creates a self-perpetuating ""Gambler's Fallacy"" which preys on your psychological weakness and makes you spend more money.

I hear the argument all the time that ""Games are a business and they need to make money,"" but that doesn't excuse a business model that is so blatantly scummy and predatory upon the weak-willed, any more than it justifies companies like Enron to exist.

So I can only really think of two justifications for the Free-to-play business model:

1) A fool deserves to be separated from his money.

2) It gives the strong-willed a chance to practice spotting and circumventing scams and not spending their money wastefully.

If anyone's got any other ideas, let's hear them. Because from where I stand, these two things are so laughably contrary to what the spirit of a video game is supposed to be that it just disgusts me. Sure, there might be elements of an interesting game somewhere in there, but the pressure to pay is so psychologically harmful that it's not worth it to get involved.",Inceptagon,t3_1q5w5k,,,ORIGINAL_POST,2

Doesn't this only get worse with traditionally purchased games? I mean with LoL if I hadn't enjoyed it I could have just uninstalled it without having lost any money at all. If I had had to purchase it for $30 then I would have 'put part of my soul' into the game only to later discover I didn't enjoy it. I certainly know I own some games I don't like that much that I still feel like I should give another go simply because I've already invested in them. With FTP you don't pay until you know you like the game.

&gt; So I can only really think of two justifications for the Free-to-play business model:

3) More people get to play the game than would otherwise.

4) A business model based on constant transactions allows constant updates and improvements.

146813,2087_B,"I think you've made a lot of good and valid points here that I'd like to address. If you wouldn't mind, I'd like to break them down a bit so I can talk about them a bit more specifically.


**1) That people getting offended here are so being they are latent homophobes**

I think this is more an outcry of how homophobic the use of the ""I AM GAY"" thing is and/or how unprofessional it is. It's not so much of a ""Someone called you *gaaaay*? That must have hurt you so much!"" but ""Someone called you gay, what an unprofessional douche!""
Also, I think a lot of the embarrassment that the man felt here is this would have been extremely tacky or strange for a gay person to do to their luggage. If I was gay, I'd be embarrassed if someone did that to my luggage, even it was true. I'd have to carry this giant, attention grabbing sign saying ""I AM GAY"" past hundreds of onlookers who have no reason to think I wouldn't have put it on myself as some sort of cry for attention.

**2) A straight person being called gay should garner the same reaction as a black person being called white.**

As far as JUST the issue of being offended by being gay compared to being offended by being black, being black is something you can see right away. If someone called a white person black, no one would believe them, there would be literally no way to prove it right. With being gay, there are no instantly indicating factors. If all gay people had blue skin, I doubt anyone would ever call anyone gay as an insult who didn't have blue skin.

Also, as a side note, many black people who have light skin *hate* being called white, either as an insult or an innocent mislabeling, and I doubt they are racist.

**3) That a straight person being offended at being called gay is a sign of latent homophobia.**

Although I believe this *can* be true, I don't think it's *always* true. I think a lot of it is just that people don't like having their sexuality, something that only they can know and has played a large portion in their life, openly questioned. For instance, I've had bisexual friends who have both been told ""Oh you're just fully gay, admit it"" or ""You're not actually gay, you're just straight and pretending"" (or something along those lines). They obviously had no problem with gay or straight people, but it's just straight up incorrect and it bugs them when people say it.

I've also had transgender friends, and it really annoys them when they get misgendered. Like in the situation of calling a transwoman ""sir"" by accident, they have nothing against men but it just really bugs them being sincerely called something they know they're not. It's part of their self identification, and it's a pain in the ass to have that challenged or ignored. ",Mi_Pasta_Su_Pasta,t1_ccrfxpy,1381765335,2,t3_1oee4l,3

148949,2114_A,"From what I know, the birth control pill (used by 54% of American women) became available with no copay in 2010. However, ED medication was available with no copay for a very long time. I come from a country with socialized healthcare (and thus this would never be a problem), but I am interested in American healthcare since there is a lot to be critiqued. My friend who is American told me that he thinks that it isn’t immoral because

* ED can cause health problems such as depression, insecurity which can manifest into other health problems, etc. due to not being able to have/maintain an erection

* Choosing to cover birth control pills is random and discriminates against women who can’t use pills but may use other methods (such as an IUD)

* That covering birth control pills if it helps with other conditions (PCOS for example) is fine, but covering it just so people can have sex is not

The reasons I think this is immoral is because

* The whole purpose of ED meds is solely to be able to have sex. By not allowing birth control for sexual purposes, you’re discriminating against women and men who agree to have sex the safe way. ED meds may allow sex to happen, but birth control pills allow it to happen safely.

* The biggest issue my friend said was that ED can turn into other problems when left untreated, such as depression. My argument is that being pregnant and giving birth can turn into other problems. Some women (and even some men!) suffer from post-partum depression (therefore BOTH things can cause depression) and I think we all agree that there are far more medical problems associated with pregnancy than ED. Also, given that abortions are not necessarily available, accessible (in terms of cost) or even safe for some women, that isn’t always an option to avoid those problems. 

* I believe it discriminates against the poor, who are the people who need it the most. We all know people are going to have sex, and when given the option to do so safely, they will probably choose it. By this I mean that we see higher teen pregnancy rates in states where there is abstinence-only education. Giving people the knowledge of how to prevent birth and giving them the tools to do so, will generally decrease unplanned pregnancies. Poor people don’t have as much money to freely buy birth control and it is unrealistic to ask them to not have sex. I believe this creates a cycle of poverty which is immoral to propagate.

* ED is primarily caused by lifestyle choices. Without addressing all of those things first, it is immoral to cover a drug that can most likely be treated through healthier living while not covering birth control, as birth control protects both men and women from a perfectly healthy fact of life (that people have sex).

* Allowing birth control pills to be covered isn’t random, since it is the most widely used form of contraception after condoms. I believe it is ideal to allow all forms of birth control to be free (condoms, pills, IUD, diaphragm, etc.), but this is a step in the right direction. In ranking from most preferable to least, my opinion is: both ED and contraception covered, only contraception covered, only ED covered, none covered. 


CMV!

Edit: deltas awarded to /u/PizzaOnEarth and /u/GnosticGnome for showing that my premise is wrong. Apparently Viagra is in fact rarely covered, and is strictly regulated (only a certain number of pills/month and no flexibility on that number) and apparently birth control is very often covered, with little to no co-pay. Thanks everyone!

Edit 2: delta awarded to /u/ChangingHats for showing me that my premise is wrong, based on the fact that health insurance companies can't be expected to do the moral thing, but rather simply look at ROI and therefore my argument becomes an economic one and it is useless to argue economics vs. morality.
The delta is also for reiterating the point that I was comparing two things that are fundamentally different, and when actually comparing analogous medical treatments, it is again an economic reason and not a moral reason for these things being covered/not covered. 

However, I still believe there is hypocrisy in the (sometimes partial) coverage of ED meds and no (rare) coverage for equivalent female-specific arousal disorder treatments, which can be cheaper than the male equivalent. Another issue to be discussed another day.

151988,2142_B,"Currently in America, rape is defined by the FBI as *penetration* of the mouth, vagina, or anus without consent, and this definition is cited in national statistical surveys and research on rape. I disagree with this definition because it excludes men who are raped by being forced to penetrate someone's mouth, vagina, or anus, which is currently categorized as sexual assault. In a NYTimes article by describing society's blind spot towards male rape victims, 1/21 men have been (or attempted to be) made to penetrate in non-consensual sex or receive oral sex, but are not considered rape victims under the current definition.

Legally, men who are attacked this way cannot seek justice as a rape victim, but rather as a sexual assault victim, which may result in lower sentences for the attacker. Men made to penetrate may not be able to access recovery resources restricted to rape victims. Lastly, this archaic definition may perpetuate equally archaic views on male rape, such as ""men cannot be raped by women"" or ""an erection means consent,"" even though erections can be an involuntary response. 

**Tl;dr** Women can force men to have nonconsensual sex through ""forced enveloping,"" and this should be covered under the definition of rape. People who prefer the current definition, what is your thought process? 

Note: The current definition also excludes a variety of non-penetrative sex, but this blindspot affects the most people, so I'm curious to see people's view about this first.

* 1) Healthcare is screwed up. I am fairly healthy, and I cannot schedule a Dr. appointment because I have not been to the doctor in a long time. Because of regulations implemented by our healthcare reforms, I would have to go through the process that every new patient goes through, and this would cost $$$ and take weeks. I have bad eyes, and I need new glasses. My University schedule won't allow me to make an appointment at the eye doctor covered by my parents insurance, so I will have to wear old glasses until I can squeeze in a check-up in a visit to home. I can't just find an eye-doctor and get looked at. Fuck. 

* 2) Our education system is terrible. I was lucky enough to be homeschooled by my parents, and have easily kept up with, and surpassed my peers through my first two years of college. I was about the top 15 in my school at the end of my sophomore year. Students who spent 8 hours a day, 7 days a week, for 14 years were dropping out of intro classes because they didn't have the study skills and prior knowledge. 

A large portion of the school year here is spent preparing students for specific standardized tests, instead of teaching them real-world skills.

Also, education here is extremely expensive. I was lucky enough to have two of four years paid for, cheap rent, scholarships, and generous parents, and I will still have &gt; $10,000 in debt when I graduate. Then, I have to find a job, which brings us to . . .

* 3) Our economy, which is terrible. I know Europe is suffering to, as well as the rest of the globe, so this isn't going to be solved by leaving America, but we are run by greedy politicians that put us deeper and deeper into debt, while unemployment goes up and up. I work at a grocery store, and a massive amount of people rely on government programs to buy their basic food and toiletries. This is sad.

* 4) I hate the culture, especially among the youth, here in America. I know I would likely find this same culture anywhere else in the world. It's full of people obsessed with sex and the latest celebrity gossip. No one has serious conversations, and most stay glued to their phones. 

I might sound pessimistic here, but I really am lucky to be living in a (somewhat) free and safe country, and I've been blessed withe great parents and friends.

There's your problem. You're 19. You know nothing. Your life has just begun. Give it some time. In six or seven years you'll be capable of making a more informed decision.

Healthcare is screwed up? Well, thank Obama for that. Either way we have a good system, minus the Obamacare bullshit. If you have the money, you can get healthcare. I think that's a lot better than letting a board of doctors decide who gets taken care of and who doesn't. Not to mention waiting for fucking ever to get an appointment because everyone has healthcare and everyone is trying to get to the doctor for one thing or another. 

Our education system isn't the best. But you know what? It's not great everywhere else either. You get out of education what you put into it. If you want to learn more about something, if you want to educate yourself, the Internet is there. The library is there. Knowledge is all around you. If you rely solely on educational institutions for education, you're doing it wrong. K-12 schooling is not meant to teach you everything you need to know. It's there to give you the most basic general knowledge of things. And of course it's standardized. It has to be. Otherwise, you'd have one state with an amazing educational program and another state that is absolute shit. Standardization sucks, and it tends to dumb things down, but it's better than no standards at all.

Greedy politicians are a fact of life and have been for as long as any form of human government has existed. The system of government that we now have is about as good as you can get with the composition of this country. That's something you can not change. Power corrupts people. Even the most kind-hearted people that go into politics become a little greedy. It's self-preservation. And don't even try to say 'if I was a politician...' because you have no idea, any more than I really do.

As far as American culture among youth - this goes back to you being 19. I was in your shoes when I was 19. I felt the same way. You know what I did? I joined the Air Force, got out of where I grew up, met a fuck-ton of people from all over the country, worked with other nations on aircraft, learned a bunch of about other cultures. I visited Europe and Canada. We're all just people, all around the world. We're all just humans. We're all just trying to do the best that we can with the light that we have. Youth will be youth and they will always be aggravating to most people. When you're young, you're concerned with social things - the way you look, act, talk. Your material possessions and social clout, your sense of humor and your network of friends. There is no difference between the youth of today and the youth of, say, the 80s. The only difference is in the methods of communication - instead of sitting on porches in the neighborhood and gossiping with each other face-to-face, youth are chatting it up online. What's wrong with that? Not a whole lot. Think of it this way - there is more writing and reading going on today then there ever has been in the entire history of the written word in the form of Facebook comments, twitter feeds, news articles, messageboards, and other online communication mediums. I think that's a great thing. Writing and reading are the prime form of communication between people in the developed world, it seems.

What it all boils down to, man, is that you're too young to be making these kinds of decisions and worrying about this kind of shit. The economy sucks, sure - but it won't suck forever. These things move in cycles. Healthcare is bullshit right now but the whole system is in transition and there will be bumps along the way. American culture among youth - that problem, for you, will go away eventually. You'll get older and you'll stop paying attention and learn to tune it out. When you get done with college or get a job or whatever your situation is and you work with adults on a regular basis you'll figure that one out.

Don't be so negative, look for positives, and stay optimistic. Work on affecting things that you can affect, like your local situation - your school, family, and town. Educate yourself. Don't turn into another drone that just parrots what people on TV and the radio and popular music say. Come up with your own ideas and opinions and views. I was like you once. I'm 26 now, with a wife and a kid. I'm about to get out of the Air Force. I'll be honest - I've met more atheist, progressive, think-outside-the-box types in the Air Force than I ever thought possible. It helped me mature and learn and become my own person. I never went to college, but I'm hoping that that experience can do the same for you. Good luck.

154219,2181_A,"Legally, I think consent on the part of the immediate victim should be a statutorily-mandated affirmative defense to any charge in which a victim can be identified.  There are obviously evidentiary problems associated with proving consent, but we deal with them in other areas of the law and we can deal with them here.

My thought process is basically that consent negates the vast majority, if not the entirety, of the social harm caused by the crime.  I don't buy the idea that a person can hurt all of society through localized acts.  Society cannot be hurt; only people can.  If a person consents in advance to have certain actions done to him or her, he or she is not actually harmed by those actions being done.  Therefore, prior consent reduces or negates harm.

Edit: This applies to all crimes with an identifiable victim or identifiable victims (obviously in the latter case the defense must be proved for all victims), not just murder.

So, I think this is a pretty common viewpoint among smokers - pre-made cigarettes have a bunch of additives and stuff (eg. it seems modern cigarettes have paper which is supposed to stop burning if you don't puff, obviously you need more chemicals to do this and you just end up inhaling them), while when rolling your own you are putting in just tobacco, so it has to be healthier. I agree with this. Roll your own also has other benefits - they tend to be more cost-effective (but lets disregard this), and the common wisdom is that you will smoke less of them since you have to roll them and this takes time, so you end up smoking less in total, thus making them ""healthier"". Then again, I guess you can just add in a ton of tobacco and offset these effects.

So, is there a (noticeable) health benefit from moving to roll-your-own, or are they the same? I don't really feel that premade cigarettes can be healthier, but if they are, please prove me wrong.",GallavantingAround,t3_1l6jx5,,,ORIGINAL_POST,3

In typical conspiracy fashion, there was distrust of the government's requirement that cigarettes must be made with a special paper that stops the burning, but I'm digressing. He thought that e-cigs were a healthier alternative, while I remained skeptical. Neither of us know the exact science, but I think anyone can make an educated risk assessment.

If it's 5 or 10% healthier, would you feel vindicated, even though the difference is almost negligible? If it was 5 or 10% worse, would you throw away all your rolling papers and change your ways? Are you really concerned with your health, or simply looking for a way to deflect criticism of your behavior?

Examine [these statistics](http://lungcancer.about.com/od/Lung-Cancer-And-Smoking/f/Smokers-Lung-Cancer.htm) that say non-smokers get lung cancer 0.2% of the time and heavy smokers develop it 24.4% of the time. I don't know if they're ""true"" in the most objective sense, but I'll use the numbers anyway. They're probably close enough for practical purposes. Of course, if you don't develop lung cancer, you could get emphysema, heart disease, stroke, and so on, but I'll focus on the cancer.

If you are a heavy smoker, would you feel vindicated if that 24.4% dropped by 10% to 21.95%? Rolling papers would then reduce the chance of your lungs shrinking into useless black bags from 24.4% to 21.95%--huzzah, your opinion has been validated!

Let's be super optimistic. What if rolling the paper yourself dropped the rate of cancer development by 50%? Is a 12.2% chance of developing one of the most debilitating forms of cancer (vs. 0.2% of a non-smoker) still worth the pay-off?

Compared to not smoking, there is virtually no difference in health results. If the stats are right, 122 heavy smokers will develop lung cancer for every 1 non-smoker. Reduced by 10%, that's ~110 for every 1 non-smoker. 50%, 61 for every 1 non. From a risk assessment standpoint, 60 times more and 120 times more are not that different. Both are significantly higher than the lonely 1. Right in the beginning, you state ""I know this, you know this, let's not discuss it."" That's the problem, though. You need to check your bias.

It boils down to rationalization and cognitive bias. You are trying to justify a harmful activity by claiming it might be slightly healthier than a similar activity, when you perfectly know that it probably carries similar risks because it's pretty much the same activity. Whether you roll your own paper or buy them from the gas station, attempting to mitigate your damages is illogical, hypocritical, and harmful when the risks of continuing the activity still remain so high.",veggiesama,t1_cbwinoh,1377639974,2,t3_1l6jx5,3

I live in a liberal area and have always felt safe with LGBT people.

I know another argument is that it will desensitize the word.  This to me seems like a lame excuse by people that can't be bothered to stop saying ""OP is a faggot"" all the time for no reason.  I will compare it to the word nigger, because I can't think of another time in history a word has been so drastically changed from a word of pure hate to a sign of respect and love.  The meaning wasn't changed by white people overusing it.  It was changed by black people using it to describe themselves.  In the same way faggot won't be desensitized by straight people.

One of the main reasons for this is overpopulation.  Having too many people inherently causes strain on the planet's capacity to support us.  I hate to sound like a grinch or a hippie but I truly believe that having children is irresponsible for two reasons.

If I'm actually concerned about the world, wouldn't it be irresponsible to add another drain to the system?To this, there are two counters that have radically changed the way I love my life - and I am much happier for it. The first is very scientific, the second very philosophical. Both are just as powerful as the other.

**[1] Overpopulation is not the problem you think it is.** Take a look at this graph of [global population increase.](http://www.countrywatch.com/imgs/global_thematic/Natural_Increase_Rate.gif) It is measuring NIR, or *Natural Increase Rate*, which is a measure of how much a population is growing annually. According to the [Demographic Transition Model](http://www.uwmc.uwc.edu/geography/demotrans/stagesII.gif), as populations grow larger and more economically secure, birth rates slow down. You don't need to have a lot of children if they all have great chances of surviving. Countries with adequate resources flourish when populations are booming. Look at the United States, Britain, and Germany through the Industrial Revolution. They grew economically because *as their populations expanded, so did their economic markets*. Their productivity went up, and they had an abundance of people willing to buy new goods. The Industrial Revolution would not have happened without the rapid population growth experienced in the 18th and 19th centuries.

But now, notice how many of the developed nations have NIRs of below 1%, and some even have negative NIRs. Population growth is slowing down in many countries to the point that population is actually shrinking, as is the case in Germany and other European states. Governments there are actually trying to subsidize having children because it is leading to *demographic collapse*. [This pyramid](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_LqXfAvVmCkw/TB93p2bLZ8I/AAAAAAAAAJE/WVUQtZKcumE/s320/pop+pyramid.gif) patterns how populations change. If the base of young people is large, then the population increases and there is a healthy workforce. However, if the population is top-heavy, this means population is declining, and more people are retiring than are working. This leads to a production deficit as there aren't as many people on bottom to support the elders. Throw in factors like Social Security and pensions and you have an economic disaster looming.

Environmental protection CANNOT happen when economies are weak and desperate. How do you stop a man from cutting down a tree if the alternative is having his family freeze in the winter? The most environmentally-friendly countries in modern history have been those with stable economies. The world is developing industrially, and this is why population growth has slowed down and is expected by the United Nations to cap at around 9 billion. If that number peaks and falls, the world will have a major problem on its hands. The problem in developed nations is not lack of resources, but rather a lack of markets and economic growth. If you live in a developed country, the best course of action economically would be to have a child, let it contribute to the markets, and hope it does something beneficial to the world like create new technologies or found a company to provide jobs and services to people. Here's a great SciShow video on the [Science of Overpopulation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dD-yN2G5BY0).

Now, here's the one that gets me. 

**[2] There are non-quantifiable factors beside the obvious that your child's life will change.** Sure, you can look at the numbers and see what a utilitarian drain a human life is on the planet. But those numbers are only our best attempt of making sense of how well the world is doing. When it comes down to it, the only thing that really matters is how happy life on Earth is, human and otherwise. Environmental protection and health statistics are just means of achieving that abstract goal. Besides the money your kid will make or the works he will create, there is a certain immeasurable impact he will have on the world. There is no way to quantify the happiness a person brings to the lives of others just by existing - the smiles he shoots in the hallway, the tips he gives a waitress when she's having a bad day, or a poem that inspires his English teacher to make it through the week. In turn, that happiness can ripple and make others want to bring others joy. 

There's a story I heard once about a kid who was walking home from school alone. Some bullies walk by and beat him up, breaking his glasses in the process. The new guy across the street sees this happen, and after the bullies leave, the new kid goes up to the bullied and consoles him. The two become friends for the rest of high school. Later, the first kid is giving his valedictorian speech at the school. He tells the story of the day he was bullied and afterwards befriended. He says he was going home that day to commit suicide, but that one act of kindness gave him the push for just one more day. Now he's going off to college.

I don't remember where that story came from, and I don't care if it's true or not. Stories like these don't cure cancer, nor do they build schools in Africa or plant trees for the environment - but they inspire. They are testaments to the unquantifiable impact people and their works have on this world. Despite the ubiquitous pessimism with which people like to portray it, society has been consistently getting better for the past few hundred years. In the 1800s, Thomas Malthus predicted the future would be a desolate wasteland of death, famine, and overpopulation. In the same century, economists predicted the population of New York by 1950 would be zero because of the environmental collapse brought on by overpopulation. But evidently, we found a solution to circumvent this prediction - more people are living longer, healthier lives than ever before. Sure, the demographic trends might look scary, but people always find a way. Economic powerhouses might look like gigantic producers of waste and destruction, but they are also the homes of some of the greatest advances in human history. I see no reason to suggest this won't continue. Your child, like you, has the potential to change the world - whether he means to or not.",degan97,t1_cb9w70x,1374747120,255,t3_1j0ghg,3

Thanks Degan97.

Looking at your arguments and the data you provided started to put my mind on the idea that having children will have an environmental effect that is directly opposite of what I worried about in my original post.  Plus the philosophical argument about how happiness requires people in order to flourish -- excellent.

While I can't say I'm fully convinced -- and I'll readily admit that I'm not fully convinced due to ideological inertia and emotion -- you set me on the path to more research and personal deliberation.  I really appreciate it.

Speaking of that lust, he burns down Paris because he wanted to bone a gypsy. That takes some dedication right there.

However, it doesn't seem too common.  Moving on: 

The entire idea of GW Plus is to glorify unhealthy, overweight female bodies.

With GW Curvy, it seems like a similar concept. Create a place for overweight women to show off their naked bodies, and call it something that sounds prettier (curvy) so they don't feel bad about themselves.

There are many arguments that *appear* strong. One example that I can think of is the [ontological argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontological_argument) (Platinga's and Anselm's are the most popular in my experience). If someone were questioning their religious beliefs, coming from an atheistic starting point, and they aren't well versed in logic then the ontological argument seems quite strong.

What of those that define God as ""A timeless being that is the cause of the universe"". Then all of a sudden we have first cause arguments and teleological arguments for further support. Again, if you aren't well versed in cosmology and haven't seen any formal objections to the premises these arguments can appear to very strong and support this definition of God.

Arguments for design in regards to Abiogenesis are also strong at a glance. Very few individuals understand the hypotheses currently put forward or the experiments conducted. There are plenty of smart individuals who believe that there was non-life and then *bam* a single celled organism that we would recognize formed. This confusion can be used to question the probability and then suggest that there must be a guiding hand of some sort.

181451,2499_B,"Historically, human population growth went along with increases in food production and the switch from subsistence farming to larger scale farming and eventually industrial farming. 

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming, like crop rotation, better plowing tools, use of animal labour, use of manure as fertilizer, breeding of crops and livestock, chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides, and, as of late, genetic modification of crops.

Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. 

I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies, and is what we here know as a ""first world problem"". This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more wide-spread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.

I don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, and yes, there are risks, hazards and dangers associated with them. I don't contest either, that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good, especially when used naively.

However, science and engineering progress all the time, pesticides become better, more specific, fertilizers become better to handle, cheaper and less energy-intensive to produce, GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past, that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.

And thus, I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad, and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods, using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as ""bad"" while labelling something that came out of a cow's arse as somehow magically ""good"", and instead have a sane cost/benefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.

Quite simply, we must not throw away much of the food production techniques what served us well the last couple of hundred years because that could kill a large portion of humans alive today.

The movement of organic is not against the drive of larger production, but rather is holding it back until it has been properly analyzed before being released.  Currently our ""First world problem"" isn't just that chemically treated plants are less than optimal, but that the mass production of food is *unregulated* and extremely wasteful.

I enjoy discussing philosophy, but I increasingly feel that the philosophical questions lose their magic when you break them down critically.

My philosophical viewpoint rests on two premises that to me seem uncontroversial *(Edit: their controversy status is not central here; think of them as one metatheory that can lead to answers)*:

- The human mind is an instinctive, emotional, stereotypic and subconscious machine, subject to [hundreds of cognitive biases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases) and prone to [hundreds of logical fallacies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fallacies).

- Materialism is the default position until evidence of the contrary is shown.

---

***Categories of fallacious trivialities***

I contend that *philosophical questions in general* *(edit)* can be put into one or more of these five categories:

**1.1.** The concept is a humanly conceptualized [prototype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prototype_theory) without clearly definable boundaries. The question is as meaningful as ""at what shade does the color red cease to be red?""

**1.2.** The concept is an artifact of human intuition. Any reasoning will concern human subjectivity rather than the universe around us.

**1.3.** The question is merely a semantic dispute or a syntax error.

**2.** The question can easily be answered within materialistic (or otherwise Ockhamian) axioms. This does not denote absolute truth, but should be the default position.

**3.** The question is ill-suited for philosophy. No amount of purely philosophical reasoning can *(be verified to)* bring one closer to the truth. *(Edit: I've conceded that it might be an arbitrary category.)*

---

***Evaluations of some ""[unsolved problems in philosophy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unsolved_problems_in_philosophy)""***

**Aesthetics - Essentialism:** *Are there essential properties that make a thing what it is?*

See **1.1**. It depends on if the thing is already defined by those essential properties. The roundness of a geometrical shape will determine how central it is to the ""circle"" *prototype*, but it can only have a binary relation to the ""perfect circle"" *definition*. Almost all physical things are prototypes of vastly different gradualities.

*Does the quality of art correlate to its degree of organic form?*

See **1.2**. Even on a subjective basis, it's a very weak idea.

**Aesthetics - Art objects:** *What is art?*

See **1.1**.

**Epistemology - Gettier problem:** *Can knowledge be defined as justified true belief?*

See **1.1**. No, as Gettier shows.

*What is knowledge?*

See **1.1**.

**Epistemology - Molyneux problem:** *If a man born blind, and able to distinguish by touch between a cube and a globe, were made to see, could he now tell by sight which was the cube and which the globe, before he touched them?*

See **3**. The article itself mentions that this might not be an unsolved problem in philosophy, due to scientific studies.

**Epistemology - Infinite regression:** *As it is impossible to satisfy the justification element due to infinite regression, can one truly have knowledge of anything?*

See **2**. No. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.

**Epistemology - Münchhausen Trilemma:** *It is impossible to prove any certain truth even in fields such as logic and mathematics. The proof of any theory rests either on circular reasoning, infinite regress, or unproven axioms.*

See **2**. See the previous question: it's a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. However, a proposition can theoretically be true *within an axiomatic framework itself* (but you can't be 100% certain that you wrote that axiom five seconds ago).

**Epistemology - Qualia:** *Is your blue the same as my blue?*

See **2** and **1.2**. If our brains are the same, then necessarily so.

*Is a human experience inherently different from that of philosophical zombie or a sufficiently advanced AI?*

See **2** and **1.2**. No.

**Ethics - Moral luck:** *A poor person is born into a poor family, and has no other way to feed himself so he steals his food. Another person, born into a very wealthy family, does very little but has ample food and does not need to steal to get it. Should the poor person be more morally blameworthy than the rich person?*

See **1.2**.

**Philosophy of language - Moore's disbelief:** *A first-person present-tense sentence such as, ""It's raining but I don't believe that it is raining"" is paradoxical.*

See **1.3**. The full form ""I believe that it is raining, but I don't believe that it is raining"" is a trivial syntax error.

**Philosophy of mathematics - Mathematical objects:** *What are numbers, sets, groups, points, etc.? Are they real objects or are they simply relationships that necessarily exist in all structures?*

See **2**. They are formal abstractions of the world around us -- not vice versa.

**Metaphysics - Sorites paradox:** *Is a bale of hay still a bale of hay if you remove one straw? If so, is it still a bale of hay if you remove another straw (ad infinitum)?*

See **1.1**.

**Metaphysics - Counterfactuals:** *What is meant when one asserts a conditional statement, the antecedent of which is contrary to fact? E.g. ""If Joseph Swan had not invented the modern incandescent light bulb, then someone else would have invented it anyway.""*

See **1.3**.

**Metaphysics - Material implication:** *In formal logic, the statement ""If today is Saturday, then 1+1=2"" is true; a causal or meaningful relation is not required. There is a discrepancy between material implication and the general conception of conditionals: is it an inadequacy in formal logic, an ambiguity of ordinary language, or no discrepancy?*

Valid question by itself, but see **3** and **1.2**.

**Philosophy of mind - Mind-body problem:** *Is the mind separate from the physical body?*

See **1.2** and **2**. No.

**Philosophy of mind - Cognition and AI:** *What are the criteria for intelligence?*

See **1.1**.

*Is it possible to artificially create consciousness?*

See **2**. Theoretically yes.

**Philosophy of mind - Hard problem of consciousness:** *Why is there a subjective component to experience?*

See **1.2** and **2**. *(Edit: personal hypothesis)* Short answer -- evolution. It seems clear that an organism with a conception of a coherent self-experience would have an evolutionary advantage. For how it actually arose, see **3**.

**Philosophy of science - Problem of induction:** *(1) Any inductive statement (like the sun will rise tomorrow) can only be deductively shown if one assumes that nature is uniform. (2) The only way to show that nature is uniform is by using induction. Thus induction cannot be justified deductively.*

See **2**. Indeed, it's as previously mentioned a trivial notion that nothing can be known with 100% certainty. Pragmatically, it doesn't matter.

**Philosophy of science - Demarcation problem:** *""The problem of finding a criterion which would enable us to distinguish between the empirical sciences on the one hand, and mathematics and logic as well as ""metaphysical"" systems on the other""*

See **1.2**. Mathematics and logic are not divine concepts, but rather useful human inventions based on axioms from what seems inductively obvious to us. Distinguishing between completely physical fields and completely abstract fields seems like the only possible answer. Human intuition might lead one to believe that there is a gradualness between physics and mathematics for example, but in reality, mathematics is a thoroughly abstract model of a study that is physical by definition. As for ""metaphysical systems"", see **2**.

**Philosophy of science - Realism:** *Is there a world independent of human beliefs and representations?*

See **1.2** and **2**. The subjective reality is a model of the objective reality, filtered by cognitive and sensory limitations.

I will give you a ∆ if you:

- Convince me that at least one of these questions (or some other question(s) of equal weight) is valid within the realm of philosophy.

- Point out a considerable flaw somewhere in my reasoning.

- Convince me in a logical manner that my view of philosophy is misguided.

Please refrain from fallacies such as these:

- Appeal to authority: *""Do you seriously think you know better than centuries of professional philosophers?""* This is irrelevant to the veracity of the question.

- Appeal to emotion: *""Philosophy can be fun/intriguing/thought-provoking!""* Certainly!

- Appeal to influence: *""Philosophy is important and has influenced a lot of fields and lead to great changes!""* Absolutely! My question refers to the intellectual soundness of contemporary philosophy per se, among professionals and laypersons alike.

I believe that the NoFap movement is destructive in the same way that any abstinence movement is: it enshrines the thing it's banning in such a way as to empower it beyond what's realistic.  I believe that NoFap is no different than waiting for marriage, which is a whole different CMV, in the way it denies human beings their desire to find physical communication with others, explore their own sexualities, and understand the other sex.


I believe that self-denial is dangerous, unhealthy, and unrealistic.  I believe that NoFap is destructive to the way men see women as they are placing desires that would otherwise be explored through pornography in other human beings, thus elevating them to standards that they will never meet, damaging the way men interact with women.


Yes, I understand that the same argument can be flipped by saying that pornography reduces women to dangerous archetypes, too, but I don't buy that argument: Vin Diesel is always a bad ass every time I see him on a screen, but I don't really think he could fuck anyone up, because I can differentiate between performance and reality.   


And finally, I believe that NoFap is an excuse for insecure men to blame their own sexual desires and personal inadequacies for the fact that they can't speak to women.  I believe that it's creating a fake solution for a real problem, and creates much worse problems as a result.

190691,2636_B,"The way I see it, the media does not really ""promote"" a type of family unit as a whole. The media generally outputs what we are already. The fact that the media sells the nuclear family because it is the average of what exists. If the average family were a three parent, three child group, that is what the media would show. Think of it more as a mirror of average real families rather than a depiction of what you should idealize.

Additionally, those love stories depict dilemmas as you described because it is something that many people can relate to. That is the way the majority of the world really does work, not just some movie fabrication.

In the real world, most people would have a hard time getting love interest A and B to go along with dating them together. It isn't normal for that to happen. That doesn't make it unhealthy or wrong for it to happen, it's just a situation most people are not comfortable with, and thus audiences would not be able to identify with it and it wouldn't sell.

I don't see how you could interpret the trope as harmful. Even if you think people are only monogamous because they were trained to be, you are simply advocating a new thing to train into people. Displaying the average excludes the lowest number of people. The only way for the media to not exclude any one would be to depict nothing. Promoting an atypical relationship status as ideal alienates the masses, and the media doesn't do that.

While this didn't change my view completely, it did give me a better idea of what my view actually *is*.

I think part of why people have a hard time getting LIA and LIB to go along with a ""V"" relationship is that, for a lot of people, poly just isn't an idea they've ever been exposed to in a non-negative way. Growing up my only experience with poly in *any* form was either church history (I grew up Mormon, so it had to be ordained by God and ""We don't practice that anymore."" and for the most part polygamy was viewed very negatively), or ""Those weird crazy people"" - from brief encounters with members of various FLDS sects.

I don't believe that the trope itself is harmful - some people, perhaps most, prefer monogamy as their relationship model, and that's totally fine. Of course they may have to choose between two or more potential partners. That is also just fine by me.

I think that the trope being *the only acceptable option available* is the harmful part.

So yes; I don't argue that polyamory is the ideal solution for all the worlds problems - or even any of them. I would just like to see it offered as a solution in media more often, and for polyamorous relationships to be shown as a viable, healthy alternative to monogamy (Big Love shows a polygamous family, but I would not consider the relationships shown to be healthy or viable, for example).",washichiisai,t1_ca3j39f,1369199038,2,t1_ca2wutl,3

191604,2655_B,"I'm obese, and I think I can legitimately argue that I'm not lazy or stupid. Before anyone bails thinking I'm going to claim illness or genetics as a cause, I'm not. It is wholly my own actions that have led me here and I take full responsibility for them.

Obese people generally know more than normal weight people would ever know about losing weight and how the body functions. I could talk with you all day about TDEE, basal metabolic rate, the energy equation, hormonal controls, the structure of lipids and how they accumulate in the body. I could probably serve as a dietician and physical trainer effectively. I could tell you all about the merits and disadvantages of specific eating approaches. I could tell you about the most recent studies regarding workout efficiency. I could tell you about all the myths like negative calorie foods, cleanses, cardio zones, and starvation mode. So stupid, no, not when it comes to weight gain and loss anyway. 

Lazy, that's trickier - if you consider lazy to mean not moving enough to create a caloric deficit based on how much energy you consume, then yes, I'm lazy. But I go to the gym twice a week, I walk 2 miles every day, and I'm a caregiver and home owner so my physical chores don't end when the work day is done.

So why am I obese? Habit is the answer, and habit is not thing you can really brush off as a product of stupidity or laziness. Put simply, my battle with weight is a battle with forty years of very gradual caloric surplus. It's also a battle with slightly deficient psychological coping abilities. Years of therapy have taught me that I have tended towards eating as an escape from stress, distress, boredom and a variety of other emotions that everyone develops different coping mechanisms for. Some people escape into drugs, alcohol, sports, computer games, tv, masturbation, fetishes, shopping, gambling... Whatever gives them the chemical fix (and yes, it's all about serotonin and dopamine and a variety of other chemical messengers in your brain). I escape into food... 

I guarantee you also have escape activities and coping activities. Ask yourself what they are and imagine knowing that unless you give them up they would dramatically increase your risks of early death and make you a social outcast. Could you?

Add to this the fact that the odds are stacked against emotional eaters in some very specific ways. For one thing, food is extremely hard to avoid. If you have an addiction to cigarettes or alcohol or gambling or drugs you can basically lock yourself away from those things until a new pattern of habit is formed, but food is in your life and around you every single day. You don't have to eat junk food to get obese... You just have to consume more energy than you burn - even just a few calories a day over your TDEE and given enough time you'll get there. Emotional eaters are surrounded by their drug every minute of every day. Imagine being a smoker who was trying to quit but every day a platter of cigarettes was placed in your office kitchen, billboards for them scream at you on the way home, smoking ads fill your tv, your spouse presents a pack to you for your evening sustenance, every family gathering is centered around and focused on smoking... I hope that gives a sense of some of the difficulties.

I won't even get into the research companies that load pretty much every packaged foodstuff in the western world with sodium, fat, sugar and various other chemicals specifically designed to addict people to the products.

My battle with weight continues, and will do so until I either succeed or die. It's a battle with habit, addiction, emotion, and I implore you to have a little more empathy for people in my situation. Putting it down to something as simplistic as laziness or stupidity is really quite inaccurate and also adds to the exhausting, ostracizing world we obese people have to inhabit.

Some people just naturally follow a path of moderation in all things, others struggle with it without there being an element of laziness or stupidity. I wish I knew why but I presume if I had the answer I wouldn't be struggling with weight in the first place. 

I have to say I applaud you for seeming genuinely interesting in changing your view on this. It takes a strong person to not fall back on patterns of attributing personality traits to over-simplistic issues.

One thing I forgot to mention in my first post, but I think it bears consideration, is the recidivism rates for obesity is something like 95% regain within 5 years. I experienced this myself - a few years back I truly knuckled down, started going to the gym 5 times a week, ate mostly paleo, I lost fifty pounds. They say it takes a month or two to replace an old habit with a new one but for me that evidently wasn't the case because I was very successful for well over a year. So much so that I thought I'd 'won', I thought I'd finally figured it out. But here I am a few years later with almost all the weight back and mentally preparing myself for another attempt... One more swing. Most of us always keep swinging, if you don't cultivate the concept of never, ever giving up then it's too easy to despair. I know I for one sometimes look on people who have a thoughtless tendency toward moderation with genuine envy. They never have to play the exhausting mental games to control their undesirable behaviors. 

I look on people who have been obese, lost it, and kept it off for &gt;5 years as some of the most amazing, strongest willed individuals on the planet.

198878,2781_B,"Last night I went to a show at a venue with ~500 person capacity. It's a mix of tables with chairs for people who want to eat, bar tables, and standing room. People line up really early (an hour+ before doors open), because there are no ins and outs, and if you go in at doors open, and don't get a seat, you will be standing for a while. 

I arrived right at doors open, and thus wasn't expecting a seat, and didn't find one. However, the obese couple directly behind us in line asked management upon coming in that they set up some extra seats, because they couldn't stand for the show. Management obliged, and the couple ended up partially blocking an aisle-way, with seats right next to people how had been in line for over an hour. 

On the one hand, there's really nothing that separates their ability to stand for a show from a disabled person's. They were big enough that there's no way they could do it. So in that respect I understand why management accommodated them.  I suppose the reason I feel the way I do, is because the vast majority of obese people got that way by choice, but that doesn't really hold up. I definitely wouldn't feel the same way about a chainsaw juggler who had only one leg. I'd be OK with him getting a seat. I suppose you could extend it even further to a disabled soldier. They chose to go to war, yet I don't begrudge them their accommodations.

In this particular situation, I'd tend to say it's the responsibility of the person that needs to sit to show up early, regardless if they were born disabled, disabled in an accident, or if they disabled themselves. However, this goes beyond shows. I remember [there was a thread a few weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/1b3tio/airline_fat_tax_should_heavy_passengers_pay_more/) about whether obese people should be forced to pay for an extra seat in an airplane instead of making that decision themselves, and I recently heard [an NPR story](http://www.npr.org/2013/02/20/172470371/being-obese-can-weigh-on-employees-insurance) about wellness programs at work, and whether it's fair for employers to provide benefits and levy penalties based on how healthy employees are. 

I don't have a problem with either the ""fat tax"" for airline tickets, or mandatory wellness programs, but I don't think I'd feel the same if airlines charged a fee for passengers in wheelchairs, or if employers raised premium contributions for every quarter that went by without one of their employees beating their crones diagnosis.

But the same is true for many other disabilities; if a diabetic doesn't take his insulin, should we not call an ambulance?

198880,2781_B,"&gt; But the stats show a ridiculous growth of obesity over the past thirty years, and it's clearly systemic, not individual;

Holy shit that GIF is really impactful. This is an excellent point. Probably the only one made thus far that begins to change my view. If we are all getting fatter as a result of systemic problems, and it is in fact now a big effort to stay un-obese, then it could be that they shouldn't be required to pay any extra for anything. The only thing I'd like to point out, is that even in those beige states at the end, you were still only seeing 25% obesity. I get that it's an alarming trend, and I'm sure that it indicates systemic involvement, but that's by no means a majority. 

&gt; I'd say that we should try to provide incentives for improving health -- so wellness programs are okay, but not to seek to punish -- so refusing the chairs isn't.

First, I'd like to say that I'd never be in favor of denying benefits. I'm talking about adjusting costs. The only situation where I could see refusing the chairs as a punishment, rather than a special treatment, is if extra seating was available on request for everyone, and only the obese couple were refused. As it was, the opposite seemed to be true, that they were entitled to special treatment because they were incapable of standing. (full disclosure: I didn't ask for a chair, so I don't know whether I would have gotten one. It could be that the option was available to everyone.) 

I see not getting the chair as an increased cost of going to the show as an obese person.  My point was that they had the same opportunity to arrive early, and didn't. The arriving early is the cost-increase. They have to sit, ergo, they have to arrive early. Not, they have to sit, ergo, they can ask for additional seating regardless of when they arrive.

207537,2929_B,"Let me be perfectly clear here: I'm not attempting to trivialize genocide or ethnic cleansing or any sort of large-scale act of injustice. Every such act is abhorrent and needs to be prevented if possible, and remedied if not.

I have found myself unable to have meaningful conversations with many of my Jewish/Israeli or Armenian friends if we touch on either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. I don't think the emotional hypersensitivity they express is in any way justified considering how long ago these atrocities occurred and that they have not and will not affect them personally in any way.

My issue here really is temporally focused, which is why I'm not talking about the Rwandan genocide. Most adult Rwandans today lived through the genocide and have lost loved ones that they had met and spent time with.

I've taken to referring to a victimhood complex, where basically a significant portion of one's cultural or ethnic identity is based on being a victim, and I think it's petty and tremendously counter-productive. For example, I tried having a conversation with a Jewish friend about the ""draw the holocaust"" contest that was setup by some IranCartoon and my argument was basically that you can't defend the rights of publications like Charlie Hebdo to poke fun at Islam without also having to defend IranCartoon's rights to mock the Holocaust. This quickly turned into a lecture on how my friend's family was exterminated by the Nazis. My friend would not likely have ever met the extended family members who perished under the Nazi regime, and she is not in any way under threat here in the US.

Similarly, conversations about US-Turkey relations, or Turkey's potential role in the Middle East today devolve quickly into a ""recognize the Armenian genocide!"" rant, which I think is a little more justifiable because it involves validating one's own history, but still the issue remains that such a backwards focus is, in my mind, petty and counter-productive.

I don't think people born in the 80s, 90s or 00s, people who have not lost people whom they have met and valued, people who have hardly any personal connection to such events, are at all entitled to being overly sensitive, emotional, or upset when their narratives are questioned/challenged or when their histories are attacked or trivialized.

I think that gives a good explanation of where I'm at, but I'll do my best to clarify if needed in future edits. Again, nothing here is intended to actually trivialize either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide, or to express anything negative toward either Jews or Armenians - just addressing the reactions I've seen from young adults to certain historical topics.

212353,2993_A,"It really just seems to come down to supply and demand. Just about all of our paper comes from privately owned forests called ""managed timberlands,"" where trees are grown specifically to be pulped for paper production. No need for paper? No need for the trees. So the question is, do you want to live on a planet with more trees, or less trees? If you want more, then use as much paper as possible. Boosting demand will boost supply, and, voilà! More trees!

Same goes for endangered species. You don't see cows going extinct any time soon, do you? Why? Because we eat them. Where there's a demand, there is (or will soon be) a supply. So if McDonalds started selling a McBengal patty melt, POOF! No more looming Bengal Tiger extinction.

I'm not actually suggesting that we start eating every endangered species, or that we go around wasting paper. But it makes sense on paper. What am I missing?

EDIT: Thanks for all of your responses! This was really more of a showerthought, but I wanted help vetting whether or not these ideas held any water. The verdict: they don't, haha. But I appreciate everyone taking the time to give me a lot of solid reasons not to go around telling people they should waste paper and eat tigers. Cheers ^_^

212367,2993_A,"More with your animal point, you have to understand how McDonald's sources their  meat. It's not like they have people roam the fields of the Midwest trying to find a wild cow to make a burger. The meat they use never sees the light of day actually. They are raised from a calf to be slaughtered and kept indoors and cramped in tiny cages for that period. So if the McBengal were to come to fruition, what you would have is a lot of really fat tigers in cages and the same issue on the outside. 

For trees, it's a little different because of how they reproduce. They can usually blow their seeds far away, which would help grow trees outside the farm. However, tree farming is economically a lot less efficient than just getting them from forests. Trees take up a ton of room and don't produce a lot of yield. Most types of lumber is relatively cheap, hard to process, and expensive to transport. Now if you had to purchase a ton of land to grow them, there is not as much profit to be made as taking them from forests. So trees in tree plantations are usually just basically an artificial forest in places that land is basically free used only for farming.",PhAnToM444,t1_cq8u7k8,1428767497,4,t3_328cqj,2

Obviously not everybody is going to feel that they perfectly fit the stereotype for how ""males"" or ""females"" should behave. But, since these ""other"" or nonspecific gender identifications don't correlate to a sex that exists, it doesn't make sense to me that people should be inventing a classification for their gender.

I am the first to concede that I do not understand the trans position at all. I do not get it. I was born a dude, raised a dude, and as a dude, I abide. But I do not *feel* like a dude. It would not disrupt my experience of reality if someone started referring to me as a lady. It would not bother me if someone started talking as if I did not have any gender at all, referring to me as ""it"" or whatever. I would just roll with it. I am what I am. So what is the big deal? There is none. For me.

For other people, they seem to hold their gender identity very close to their self-concept. If a person puts a great deal of stock in being male it disrupts their experience when someone refers to them as a female. And it is easily more general than that: if someone identifies as young and someone refers to them as old, or Russian and someone refers to them as ""white"", or they identify as a software engineer and someone refers to them as a computer engineer. These are all ways of imposing a false identity upon a person that is jarring for them to hear because they view themselves a certain way.

So, try not to think about it as ""simply want attention"". Sure, they want to be regarded a certain way, but that is true of nearly everyone. So it is just that they want to be regarded in a certain way that is counter to what is visually apparent to others. Fair enough. Abide. Does it matter to you what pronoun you use for them?

216082,3050_B,"They are asking you to respect their identity. It is not about fitting in better, it is about being true to themself.

On your part, if you want to understand, it is about empathy. As an experiment, pick any aspect of your identity and consider how it would feel to be repeatedly called a wrong version. An easy example from my life is from way back when I was studying software engineering as an undergraduate. My dad always called it computer engineering. Those fields have some overlap, true, but they are not the same, and I identified as a software engineering student. It was disrespectful of him to keep referring to my major incorrectly. The more respectful option would be to use the proper term.

Is it unnecessary? I am still alive so it did not kill me. The lack of respect and courtesy hurt my feelings at the time, though. How do you fit in ""unnecessary"" with feelings? I did not want him to say ""software engineer"" so I could fit in better to society. It was not about added attention. It was about validation of my self-image at the time rather than disrespectfully invalidating the way that I saw myself.

It would be like being called the wrong name, like if I was calling you ""BiffordRawford"" or something, and refused to acknowledge your username on grounds that doings so was ""unnecessary"".

The thing is that identity is mostly ""unnecessary"". Maybe you see how unnecessary it is to identify with things, but what about politesse and kindness? Even if you think it is unnecessary, it is just as easy to refer to a person by the pronoun by which they would feel better being referred.

The TL;DR version (but it is a short article) is that schools actively work to curb obesity by formulating diet and exercise plans for obese children. If the child fails to make good progress in six months, parents would be fined up to $500. If the child continues to not show significant weight loss after another six months, the parents will be fined up to $800.

I actually think that this is a good idea. It provides a monetary disincentive for parents to let their kids to get fat. Even if parents are clueless about good nutrition and healthy living habits, the school health department does all of the dietary planning; parents simply need to enforce discipline, not unlike making their kids to their homework every night.

Maher puts it perfectly at the end:

""Yes, you have your right to cram whatever you like into your pie hole but when that “personal freedom” is being abused to the point of an obesity epidemic that taxes the entire healthcare system and threatens the national budget, doesn’t the government have a responsibility to step in and tax you?""

For instance, a parent can reduce their child's weight by encouraging healthier diet and exercise.  They can also reduce their weight by starving the child.  If a family is poor, and cannot afford a penalty, do you think they might resort to starvation if all else fails?

How would this system discriminate against parents who use healthy means vs unhealthy means of weight loss?  If it's just the result of two weigh-ins, there wouldn't be any attempt to determine that whatsoever.

Meanwhile, there are already better options!  Why not simply tax food that is sugary or fatty?  Plenty of countries and cities do this already.  Why not use that money to subsidize exercise programs?

This is possible, but unlikely. During the meetings with the health counselor, if the child says that his parents are starving him so that he could drop his numbers, the parents would have criminal charges dropped on their asses faster than they can blink.

&gt;How would this system discriminate against parents who use healthy means vs unhealthy means of weight loss? If it's just the result of two weigh-ins, there wouldn't be any attempt to determine that whatsoever.

It's not just two weigh-ins. There will be follow-up meetings every four weeks to keep the plan on track.

&gt;Meanwhile, there are already better options! Why not simply tax food that is sugary or fatty? Plenty of countries and cities do this already.

I'm totally in favor of taxing junk food. If the government makes Doritos and Mountain Dew prohibitively expensive, that will also put a sizable dent in obesity rates. And since it doesn't punish poor people who might have trouble making ends meet, this is arguably a better idea than the ""fat tax"". Here's a &amp;#8710; for reminding me of that option.

&gt;Why not use that money to subsidize exercise programs?

That would only work if the exercise programs were compulsive. But if they are, they should also include health seminars for parents and children.

228142,3244_B,"This type of post has probably already been made a handful of times but I wanted to include some of my own thoughts. I live in the UK, so I have grown up in a country that does provide universal healthcare. I firmly believe in this model from an ethical and social standpoint.

I've recently started reading the book Freakonomics. I wanted to see some discussions of the book on reddit, and I came across an AmA of the author, Steven Levitt. Somebody asked him his views on universal healthcare, to which he replied;

'I'm not so sure about universal healthcare.

what i think we really need is for people to pay a big chunk of their own health care costs so the whole system starts to act more like a market and less like an entitlement.  when health care is 20% of GDP, we can't treat it like an all you can eat buffet.'

Now, I'm not ranting or saying I flat out disagree with his statement factually, because I do not know enough about financial economics to do so, but as somebody who believes universal healthcare ""should"" be a human right, or 'entitlement' as Steven Levitt has put it, I struggle to understand how humanity as a whole would benefit from persisting with privatised health care. 

Essentially, to change my view, I would need to be convinced that privatised health care actually does have longstanding benefits for humanity, and not just for the 'economy'. Perhaps sustaining the economy and longevity of humanity come hand in hand, but I've always felt privatised health care primarily serves the rich who own it, and to deny healthcare to somebody who cannot afford it seems outright inhumane  to me. Perhaps somebody could show me privatised healthcare actually does benefit humanity as a whole, and not just a small percentage. 

EDIT: I was asked to link the post that 'changed my view' the most, so here it is. 

http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/2wzag2/cmv_i_believe_universal_healthcare_should_be_a/covh1ws

Admittedly I perhaps could have been more involved in the thread but I was quite literally overwhelmed with the amount of replies, to the point that the same types of responses were pouring through, deeming it almost impossible to identify which further posts would be deserving of another delta. 

Although my view is not changed in that I still believe as a society we should work towards everybody having 'free' access to basic healthcare, I am now aware of the implications of a 'human right', and how that could have serious adverse effects. 

I'm sorry if I was not totally compliant with the rules of the thread, but overall I see it as a success as it made me see things in a different perspective, and perhaps others have learnt from it as much I have.

Most people would surely agree that giving free healthcare to every human is a good thing.

Unfortunately, less people would be willing to triple their taxes to take part in providing healthcare to 7 billion people.

So what about private Vs public healthcare? It is the exact same problem with 300 million people instead of 7 billions (if you live in the US). 

If you promote public universal healthcare in your country, how is it ethical to refuse providing universal healthcare to all humans in other country? It is probably not.

Western countries have the luxury to provide sophisticated healthcare to the poor part of its population, but not to 4 additional billion people. Ethic of healthcare and economy are thus strongly connected to each other. 

You could consider that ""public healthcare"" in a country can be seen by the rest of the world as a private healthcare system paid by taxes of its citizens.",hellohellizreal,t1_covh1ws,1424781434,29,t3_2wzag2,3

The thread as a whole has made me realise that both systems are more interchangeable in the current systems than I originally thought, although my view remains that as a world population we should ethically seek to make healthcare an entitlement, although again I do not know enough factually to say this is globally feasible, and could be seen as very idealistic.

This makes them easier to knock over and spill than ordinary glasses. While their wider base alleviates this a bit, they have the additional problem of being very easy to break, so that if they do fall over, there is a good chance that they will shatter, leaving a mess that is difficult and potentially harmful to clean. On the subject of cleaning, their shape makes them difficult to clean and their fragility makes them difficult to clean well. You cannot get your hand inside them to apply pressure to certain stains, and even if you could, you still can't apply the pressure needed to clean some stains without risking breaking the glass. Furthermore, the stem of the glass is also brittle and serves no practical purpose. For these reasons, wine glasses should not be used or be expected to be used.

If so, would you also agree that we should only ever drink things out of sippy cups or Contigo travel mugs?  

But aside from that, here are some things to consider:

* The wide base of a wine glass makes more of a difference than you'd think.  Objects tip over once their centre of gravity is no longer directly above part of the base.  This angle is pretty much the same as many other glasses.  Obviously mugs are more stable, but aside from that there isn't that much difference.  [Here's what I mean](http://imgur.com/a/49p26) - the angle from this point to the edge of the base is equal to the angle you'd need to tip the glass before it fell over.

* I have successfully cleaned thousands of wine glasses and never had a single problem with breakage. 
* Because the top lip of the glass curves inwards, spills from the liquid sloshing around is less likely.  
* The thin glass of a wine glass makes it lighter and easier to carry around for long periods of time, which is good for times when one is socializing at cocktail parties and whatnot.
* Wine glasses can be held at the top of the stem without using the entire hand.  Again, good for social events where one might be holding a plate of food, shaking someone's hand, and accepting a business card all at the same time.
* Wine glasses look elegant.
* The curvature of the glass is more conducive to sipping, and makes it easier to savour the wine.  This allows for a fuller appreciation of the wine's flavours and allows the aromas to collect right under your nose.  This sipping motion also makes moderation easier.",stevegcook,t1_coa6e3k,1422996967,9,t3_2uocbs,4

238836,3407_A,"It seems like every time a holiday named after a person comes around I see a slew of historical facts about the terrible things that that person did. This is especially relevant to Colombus Day, but even applies to MLK day. Even further, this is sometimes brought up about days named after certain saints (e.g. Valentine, Patrick). I think that naming holidays after people opens up the idea behind the holiday to too many ad hominem attacks while ignoring the virtue that we are trying to celebrate.

That's why I think that all holidays currently named after people should actually be named after the virtue that person stood for. MLK day could be renamed Equality Day, Columbus Day could be renamed Discovery Day, and St. Valentines Day could be renamed Lover's Day. The only exception to this would be celebrating people's birthdays, like George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.

EDIT: I've decided the birthday exception was indefensible and no longer stand by it with one exception. Its ok if the person is still alive, like the queen of England or something.

1. It is one thing to *honor* a virtue, it is another to *embody* it. Kids don't sit around talking about the importance of helping the weak, they put on a cape and pretend to be superman. Heroes are more fun than virtues.

2. Human beings are complicated and have a variety of connections to different historical events, social trends, other famous people, virtues, major steps forward, and so on. When we honor MLK (to pick today's example) we aren't just remembering him but also JFK and LBJ, and the Freedom Riders, and Governor Wallace, and the police who shot firehoses at peaceful marchers, and everyone who filled the National Mall to listen to ""I have a dream..."", and thousands of others.

3. It's important to for people to have some vague sense that if you do the right thing, you'll be rewarded for it. In the literal sense this isn't true, because being selfless is (past a certain low minimum) not something you get rewarded for or it would actually be selfish, but this sort of deification of moral heroes helps give people a sense that the world is a moral place.",[deleted],t1_cnubeuy,1421708623,2,t3_2sy7r5,2

Alright, so, i was challenged by a friend of mine to post this here for discussion, and while i am open to ideas to modify it or drop it entirely, i will only do so if you can actually change my mind. I will not give up easily.
I believe I can change this country, better yet, this world for the better. The whole idea behind what I am about to say relates back to evolution. Humans do not allow evolution to take place properly. We save the weak. I personally believe that we should execute the weak. yes, this sounds harsh but let me explain why. We are not advancing as a race. For now though, we will keep it to America for the sake of the argument and hope the rest of the world catches on. Another massive problem we are facing is over population, we are using our resources and producing waste and pollution and mind blowing rates.
You look at animals and if an animal doesn't want to eat, it dies, if a human doesn't want to eat, it has an eating disorder and is treated for the disorder. More importantly that human is allowed to procreate. We allow shitty genetics to be passed on. We SAVE the WEAK. We also allow these morbidly obese, incredibly stupid people live and breed. If an animal in the wild isn't fit, or cannot attract a mate, it will die and or be unable to pass on its genetics. Humans may be fat and physically repulsive but if they have money they can still get women and still have children, which fucks with the gene pool. I could go on for longer in this section but if more reasoning is necessary i'll continue on later.
Now to determine who is to be executed. The type of people i want to execute are people who are not able to make a contribution to society. If you weigh 500 pounds but you're incredibly smart, you can still make a contribution to society. The opposite is also true, if you're borderline retarded but you're very physically fit, you can also contribute to society. People who are mentally unstable shall also be executed as we wouldn't want their genetics passed on and they are a threat to the gene pool we are creating.
What will determine who is executed: At the age of 14 years old, annual testing will begin based on birthday. There will be three tests, a mental test, a physical test, and a psychological test. Your Mental test exactly 3 months after your birthday and your physical test 9 months after your birthday. Tests will vary depending on your age, the older you get the harder they become, until the age of 20 where they will remain the same until 35 and gradually work their way down until the age of 65 where no further testing will be required. At the age of 20 we will also introduce psychological testing which will continue until the age of 65.
What the tests will consist of: The mental test will be a basic evaluation of your ability to do math, your ability to read and write, and your basic understanding of the sciences. This test should not be difficult, anyone who has at least a D average in school should be just fine. For the physical test, every age group will be required to complete a mile in 16 minutes. This is a very easy time to make, you can walk that pace. Physical tests will include varying push up or sit up tests depending on age group. There may be a few other exercises required in certain age groups, and the amount of repetitions will also vary depending on age. this should be easy for anyone who isn't morbidly obese. Next is the psychological test. These will be administered every 5 years to insure mental stability and health of everyone. We want the mental health of our gene pool to be good as well. Lastly, there will be certain ways to be omitted to testing, ALL WILL BE FROM SOME SORT OF SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION TO SOCIETY, the main one being in the military. If you served in the military without being dishonorably discharged, you will be exempt from any further testing in your lifetime. Another example of a way to be omitted from testing is by paying for it. The cost will be $25,000 per year, per person. Many will be angry that it's giving more power to the rich, but i see it as a valid way of determining someones potential for making a contribution to society. If you are rich, I will almost guarantee you are either physically fit enough or mentally fit enough to pass the tests and you would have been fine anyway. AN IMPORTANT NOTE: You will only have to pass 2 out of 3 tests.
How we will execute people: We will set up an organization in charge of carrying out testing and executing people. My idea is to possibly have the military be in charge of this, though I haven't had the time to think too much into that, this I am very open to other ideas on. The method of execution i think will be best is the firing squad. 8 men, 2 with real bullets to ensure death, 6 with blanks for the obvious reason. For those who are unaware, my understanding is that firing squads use primarily blanks so the gunmen aren't aware of who actually killed the person so they don't have trouble with living life after killing someone.
Now another thing i would like to do that isn't executing people, but will improve our gene pool is preventing certain people from having children. People with MORE THAN two generations of diagnosed cancer or potentially terminal illnesses that tend to be passed on genetically will be sterilized. These people will not be allowed to produce offspring, however we will make it easy for them to adopt if they would like to have children.
I would also like to place a limit on the amount of children a person may have. The maximum number of children a person may have is 3, which is a very reasonable amount. It should slow the rate of population increase or possibly make the population decrease due to some couples not having children or only having 1 child. There is no reason to have more than 3 children because at that point you're just putting a burden on society. If say you already have 2 children and you would like to have a third but you end up with twins, triplets, or even more, you will be allowed to keep them as it wasn't your intent to have that many. When you hit the limit for children you will be sterilized.

242930,3461_B,"I could write two dozen things in opposition to this, but just to gather a few basic points.

-You should understand, if you don't(seems like you don't), that what you're referring is [eugenics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eugenics), a field of thought that has existed for about as long as Darwin's theory of evolution has has a long, *very* sordid history.  Most notably, it was one of the primary justifications for Nazi Germany's genocidal practices.

-Despite it's attractiveness to certain political persuasions, [overpopulation is simply not a concern with legitimate scientific backing](https://www.pop.org/content/debunking-myth-overpopulation).  In fact, if the world continues to increase on its path of modernization, democratization and secularism, *under*population is the issue we will have to be concerned.  In highly educated, relatively prosperous societies, birth rates become lower and lower, to the point where they are now beginning to become lower than death rates in some places.  In America, if you excluded immigration, the population would not be growing.  In Japan, it's shrinking and aging outright.  It's only because of the poorer places in the world that population continues to grow substantially, and even then, the worldwide birth rate is shrinking slowly every year.

-There are any number of political oppositions I have to this but I won't get to deep into them as ultimately that's my ethical viewpoint vs. yours.  Needless to say, I think measuring the value of a human being wholly by their ability to produce and work for their country is a fascist viewpoint, and the ability of an individual to pass any kind of mental or psychological test(which undoubtedly would be designed by rich white people) is strongly dependent on the situation and opportunities they grew up with, so it doesn't even remotely approach an accurate genetic test.",BadKeyMachine,t1_cumhf65,1441096597,15,t3_3j5b7g,3

252793,3625_A,"It goes without say that mistreating zoo animals is no bueno, but I still think that zoos can be ethically justified:

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered.

252868,3625_A,"I actually agree with you, and could add many more reasons why zoos can be ethical, but that's not the point here so :

  - endangered animals can be cared for : It's true but it's only a very small portions of endangered animals that the public find cute or know about that will be protected this way. The reasons why some animals are protected in the wild or in a zoo are wildly irrational.

  - Most of these animals are 'exotic' and you concern has very little chance of changing things in these animals former countries. Also there are many other ways to attract attention to these animals than enslave them and put them in a cage. We actually did that at the World Expo in Brussels with Congolese tribesmen. And I can conclusively confirm that it wasn't really conductive to intercultural understanding and enlightenment. It was another freak show, and the exploitation of living beings for financial purposes.

So yes, zoo can be ethical but it has never been their vocation. They are not actual non-profit organizations.",andr386,t1_ctvcg39,1438991177,1,t3_3g51jj,2
253174,3630_B,"Whenever an issue relating to free speech arises it is almost guaranteed one of the responses will be ""free speech means the state can't control what you say. It doesn't mean freedom from consequences from everyone else"". If it's on the internet it is equally likely that this [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1357/) will be shown. This does seem at first to be a reasonable point of view. However, I believe it is flawed for several related reasons.

The first reason is that underestimates the power of the public. Just because the state is not infringing your right does not mean others cannot. With other rights this is accepted as part of the system. For instance, if a company refused to serve or allow access to black people that would be considered a violation of their rights despite it not being the government. In the same way, you couldn't claim a country has gender equality if women can't be get a job, despite there being no law against hiring women. Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

Secondly, the right to free speech includes the right to unimpeded free speech, if that makes sense. It is not enough to be allowed to say what you want, you have to be allowed to communicate to who you want. It makes more tense in terms of letters. Freedom of speech is not fulfilled by allowing me to write letters, it is only fulfilled by allowing their delivery. Using the example from the comic, continually showing someone the door is the same as standing by the pillar box and shredding the letters as I post them.

The final reason is that extreme reactions to someone's use of free speech can restrict it by effectively punishing them for exercising their right. If I punched someone for suggesting marmite was a valid option for toast, would I not be restricting their right to free speech? Equally, if I was sacked for making a racist reddit post, am I not being punished for exercising my right to freedom of speech? I'm not entirely convinced on this point because it might restrict someone else's freedom of speech to criticise or their freedom of association to not have to put up with me, but I would still say there is some validity to this point.

Just to be clear, I don't think freedom of speech should never be restricted but I do think those restrictions should be acknowledged which the phrase ""freedom of speech, not freedom from consequences"" does not. 

Edit: This has been quite an intense discussion. I'm beginning to think there is too much free speech. Seriously though, there has been a lot of good comments and I'll try to respond as quick as I can, although that may be tomorrow for some. I haven't missed the irony of the downvote button being used to disagree on topic about free speech, but I suppose there's always one. I have given out two deltas so far, but they tangential so the bulk of the view remains unchanged as I write this edit.

Some people seem to be confused about what I mean by a private entity. I simply mean someone who isn't the state or acting as an agent of the state. I never meant to imply that I would start talking shit in your living room. Freedom of speech doesn't make crimes less illegal do to be clear I'm not advocating that in the slightest.

Edit 3: Some people seem to be under the impression I want to expand the laws regarding free speech, probably because I'm a neo-Nazi Grand Dragon or something. That's not the case. I think the current situation I more than satisfactory. My view relates to the opinions towards free speech. To sum it up more succinctly, I don't think people can claim to be pro-free speech, when society is more than willing to restrict it. I'm *not* saying the restrictions are bad, I'm saying people should be more honest about them.

A lot of the comments have struggled with what the view is, despite it being repeated multiple times. I'm not interested in acting as reading adviser. If your comment doesn't address the view, I'm not going to bother responding.

/u/Vordreller found this bastardised version of the [comic](http://sealedabstract.com/rants/re-xkcd-1357-free-speech/), and from John Stuart Mill onwards, I agree with the sentiments the creator expresses. If you want to see my argument in comic form, you couldn't get much closer than that.

Unless freedom of speech can be distinguished from those other rights, which I believe it cannot, there can be no distinction between private agents and the state in terms of freedom of speech.

The major distinction I see here is that race, gender, sexuality, etc., those are all things that a person can't control those things about themselves. You can't decide not to be black or a woman or gay or whatever for a while because you're around people who don't like those types of people. You can try and hide it or downplay that part of you, but (at least for race and gender) those are characteristics about you that are immediately visible, permanent, and part of you. 

Speech is different. You don't ever *have* to speak. If you believe strongly that the Holocaust didn't happen, that doesn't mean that whenever you walk by a synagogue you automatically and uncontrollably start spewing out anti-Semitic comments. Speech is an action, whereas race or gender are not actions but qualities of a person which they can't reasonably change. 

That's why you can't ban someone for being black but you can ban them from shouting racial slurs in your restaurant. They can't control what race they are, but they can control what they can say. That's a fundamental difference.",noplzstop,t1_ctu19ea,1438898162,3,t3_3g1pcd,3

I understand that it's the service that they provide and not just the food, but isn't that exactly what they're paid for? To give a paying customer a good service? Although I sympathize with their outrageously low wages, but why should I have to fork out more of my money that I'm already spending at a restaurant to subsidize young Jenny here, to get her up to normal living wage?

254238,3649_A,"They are working for their wages, the only difference is that in some industries those wages come straight from the customer instead of the customer's money going to the business owner and then back to the employees. Tipping essentially cuts out the middle man, and allows you to directly pay the person providing you with a service instead of giving your money to the business, having the business take its cut, and then giving some of that money back to the employees. 

As for why you should have to, well, technically you don't (unless the restaurant/business includes a tip as a part of your bill). If tipping was eliminated then you would probably see an increase in the price of tipped services to make up for the increased wages of servers. In other words, your $10 cheeseburger might go up to $12 to make up for the 20% tip that people don't leave anymore. So instead of paying $10 with a $2 tip for that cheeseburger, you're paying $12 with no tip so the restaurant can pay its servers more than $3/hr. On top of that, the servers don't have as much of an incentive to provide top notch service since they'll be making the same amount regardless. You're drinks might take longer to get refilled, or your food might take longer to be brought to you. You're still paying the same amount, but now you're getting worse service.",man2010,t1_cts9pfj,1438784996,7,t3_3fveyg,3
254250,3649_A,"I understand that it cuts out the middle man and gives directly to the employee and in theory that's great. I guess what I fail to understand is why the establishment is not in someway forced to provide a suitable living wage to the employee. Would you say that the increase of the food price be from the restaurant trying to make ends meet, or out of maximisation of profit? 

In regards to the incentive: this is what frustrates me, there shouldn't have to be an incentive of 'extra money' in my opinion. You are paid to provide a service already and that's your wage. If the wage isn't suitable, then perhaps a call for change is in order? On top of that, if you're doing a shitty job 'cause you know you're going to get paid at the end of the day is surely bad service, and should be fired? 

Why isn't the system changed to meet the requirements and produce a solid pay, rather than the wait staff depending on money to determine their wage? 

I hope my naivety doesn't come across conservative.

What this selective outrage over Cecil tells me is that we, as a society, simply don't have any unified logic towards how we are supposed to treat animals and instead attach our moral views of animal treatment to whatever our culture finds fashionable. Walter James Palmer is potentially going to face criminal charges while Tyson and Perdue make an industry out of their treatment of animals. There is little difference. 

Edit: My opinion on this has been changed. Cecil's existence as a national treasure to Zimbabwe is enough to justify selective outrage. Moreover, Cecil's death specifically highlights issues inherent in illegal poaching.

1. Pronunciation. Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

2. Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700 (per Wolfram-Alpha, and this appears to include proper nouns). X appears in only 0.15% of English words, while Y appears in far more. I could not find an estimated percentage, but so many adverbs end in ""ly"" that it rather proves my point. Even though it's so exclusive, it is so much more versatile, as shown below.

3. Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind. 

4. Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4). 

5. Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

6. Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze. 

7. Sex. Our favorite word not only has X right in it, but the whole last 2/3 of the word sounds like saying X. Y? Nowhere to be found, unless it tags along to make something sexy. Not to mention the uses of XXX, and the fact that fairer sex is made up of X chromosomes. Y gives us baldness, hairy backs, and emotional immaturity. 

8. History. Malcolm X, not Malcolm Y. There's even ""American History X.""

9. Versatility in other areas. X can be used to show that something is crossed out, used as a check mark to indicate the choice on a form, used in cartoons to show that a person is dead, used in medicine (x-rays), used to show treasure on a map, 

10. = X. 

11. ~~No one has ever died in a state spelled with an X. Kentucky, New Jersey, New York, and Wyoming combine for 10% of the deaths in the US each year~~ I somehow came up with the 4 Y states off the top of my head and also thought there were no X states. New Mexico and Texas. 

12. If you're talking about unknown items, you always say ""X is better than Y,"" never ""Y is better than X"". 


EDIT: It worked. I was forced to rethink some of my strongest points. I still may think that X is better, but I can see that Y has its merits and can sometimes be even superior. Very clever responses in many cases, and I'm afraid I'll be banned for giving out too many deltas to people who make me rethink each point.

259318,3753_A,"Okay, let's set some things straight here. 

&gt; Saying X has a stronger, more powerful sound than saying Y, which only manages to sound a bit whiny, perhaps because is is too close to ""why.""

The question ""why?"" is reflective of a thirst for a deeply analytical understanding of something. Questions like ""what"" and ""who"" are so simple and provide so little information. ""Why,"" on the other hand, is a question which yields a far more informative, useful, and powerful response than any question of the same family. ""Why"" isn't whiny. It's conducive to knowledge. Hence, the pronunciation of the letter Y is better than X simply *because* Y sounds like why, and why is a powerful question. Much more powerful than any pronunciation of X.

&gt; Exclusivity. Only about 300 words in English start with X. Y starts over 700

Since when does lack of usage make something cool? To me, it makes something really lame. For example, who wants to hang out with the kid that no one wants to hang out with? Who wants the broken bike nobody wants to ride? Who wants the flat basketball no one wants to use? In my experience, if people aren't using something, then there's a reason. That reason is probably because they don't like it or don't find it cool. Ask the iWatch how cool it feels that no one wants to use it. What about Zune? Everyone I know loves Zune. So much, in fact, that absolutely none of them use it! As you can see, people don't use things when they suck, as is the case for the letter X. Y is used in more words because Y is a significantly more fun letter to use. X isn't used as much because it's a tricky little bastard that doesn't lend itself to be used. X is like a really smart douche bag. He/she could be really useful if he/she wasn't so fucking tough to work with. Douche bag X

&gt; Consistency. X is always a consonant. Y? Well, it cannot make up its mind.

Because everyone knows that lack of variety is the spice of life! At least for me, I love watching the exact same TV show episode over and over again. So consistent and fun. Conversely, Y is a wild dude. He doesn't wanna get tied down with one or two different tasks. He's a peacock that needs to spread his wings. And peacocks are cool, man. So much coolers than X. In fact, [a recent study by Harvard](http://reddit.com) proves that peacocks are up to 5 times cooler than X with half the trans fat. Ball's in your court, X.

&gt; Scrabble. X is worth twice as many points (8:4).

This reminds me of a Dimitri Martin skit. I'm going to misquote it but you'll get the gist. ""I was sitting on this air plane when I heard this guy say to his friend, 'Man, I'm really good at checkers.'   That's like sayings, 'Man, I'm not good at a lot of things.' ""      This is exactly what X is doing here. Scrabble is super lame. On a scale of ""Full House"" to ""Greg House"", Scrabble is like a ""Roseanne."" (Nick@Night references) Consequently, X needs to brag about something, but X pretty much sucks at everything and has to brag about Scrabble. Poor guy. Y doesn't need to be good at Scrabble because Y is good at stuff like getting checks and getting sex.

&gt; Use in math. First, x is almost always the first letter used as you learn algebra. This could go with consistency above as well, but the x-axis shows the constant, stable variable. 

Yeah, but in math, Y is usually the dependent variable. Now, I know what you're thinking. ""But Bongloads4breakfast, independence is so cool. Just look at the United States. They declared that shit and they're pretty cool."" This is the product of hegemonic capitalism and its social constructs. It's better for everyone if people become dependent on each other. If everyone is dependent on one another, then everyone has a reason to be kind to one another. You wanna know what's cooler than independence? Kindness.  

&gt; Appearance. X has a strong, stable stance. Y looks like it could topple over in a slight breeze.

Bull shit. Bull FUCKING shit. You know what looks exactly like Y? Just about every tree that exists. Trees withstand strong breezes all the time with no problems. On top of that, trees provide oxygen for us. Y = Trees = Oxygen &gt; X which also means Y &gt; X. This isn't groundbreaking. This is simply arithmetic. 

&gt; Sex.

I remember somebody telling me that JFK only lasted one minute in bed with his wife. You know why? JFK didn't have time to waste. Y has to be out there pumping out oxygen all day. As far as I'm concerned, I'd much rather have oxygen than sex. 

&gt; History. Malcolm X

Malcolm X is pretty cool. Definitely one flaw in my argument would be that Malcolm X is cool. However, the Beatles are far cooler than Malcolm X. I'm pretty sure that's a given. Guess what the Beatles sing. YYYYYYYellow Submarine. So the much cooler Beatles like using the letter Y which, ipso facto means that Y is cooler.

259596,3763_B,"First, your title is a blanket statement. It does not apply, for example to people who suffer from addiction. By definition you are only addicted to something if you can't stop doing Y even when X hurts you directly. 


Next, we need to recognize that how one person weighs the negative and positive results from Y is not necessarily how another person interprets them. X may be worth the joy you obtain from Y even though you don't like X but for me X might be to painful, or gross or whatever for me to go through with Y without trying to avoid X. That variability in weighing out the negative consequences vs the positive outcomes is important to note.

259608,3765_B,"Recently I've heard a lot about mandatory vaccination schemes in public schools. I don't see any problem with them. I've heard a few counterarguments, but they seem unsatisfying to me, for example:

1. My child, my choice. Well, yes. And this is the closest one to a valid argument, IMO. But of course we put limits on what parents are allowed to do and choose for their children; you can't deprive your child of food or education (in the US) and be allowed to keep your child, so clearly it is NOT all your choice. While refusing vaccines is nowhere near on that level, not EVERY possible choice is equally acceptable, because your child is a person, not a piece of property. If the child had the capacity to refuse, I might be swayed, but unfortunately young babies can't understand vaccines on any reasonable level. And, more importantly, it IS still your choice under school vaccination schemes; you can choose to homeschool your child, or send them to private schools that don't care. Those choices aren't available to everyone and that's unfortunate (for far more important reasons than this), but...that's our current system anyway. Being rich gets you all kinds of benefits. I don't think this is different from being able to buy better medical care, better schools, better food, private tutors, and worlds more for your child if you have the resources (I do support basic income, which would alleviate this issue, but that's neither here nor there as we haven't got it). Public schools are a governmental service, and there are rules about who can and cannot use them. I think it is fine to say only vaccinated (or medically exempt) people can use them.

2. Not everyone can get vaccinated. That's why doctors are able to issue waivers for those not medically right for vaccination. This already happens and should continue.

3. Vaccines are dangerous. Not as dangerous as rampant infection. Honestly this is its own debate...But suffice it to say you are going to need some pretty major evidence to possibly CMV. I don't think it exists, but I won't rule it out. I don't really want to talk about vaccine efficacy as it has been done to death, but I guess if there's some truly amazing evidence...

4. Everyone is entitled to an education. They still are. Any unvaccinated child either needs to attend a non-public education option, be homeschooled or eschooled, provide a medical certificate that says they shouldn't be vaccinated, or get the shots. I don't necessarily have a strong view on the best way to handle noncompliance, and don't know enough about policy to say what would be most effective and just. Maybe fines for the parents? The same punishment as parents who refuse to send their kids to school or teach them at home for other reasons? I would not support removing the child from the home or incarcerating the parents, or any other severe punishment.

What would change my view: evidence that such a policy would have clear public health risks, would unavoidably keep children from getting an education, or would have some other major negative effect on society. I also am open to the idea that it is fundamentally unjust, though it doesn't seem that way to me right now.

Edit: My post focuses mainly on why I think mandatory vaccination isn't bad, but it occurred to me that it might be helpful to say why I think it's good. Mainly, I think it's good because it protects those who cannot be vaccinated and the minority of children for whom the vaccine was ineffective or wore off sooner than it ""should have"" based on medical guidelines. Children should be safe at school, and I think this promotes safety in a significant way--since children can die of preventable illness.

Edit2: If vaccines are prohibitively expensive and can't be obtained for free, this system is pretty shit for poor families. In my area you can get free vaccines in certain conditions, which are very lenient. If this isn't true everywhere in the US (and it almost certainly  isn't), it should be before vaccines are made mandatory.

259633,3765_B,"So I do think this policy I justified, but I don't think it's a good mechanism for mandatory vaccination.

The people who insist on not vaccinating their children do so because they think it would be harmful for their child, and some of them probably hold this belief strong enough so that they would not enroll their children in school. Are anti-vaxxers really the people you want homeschooling children? The comparison here is, with mandatory vaccinations, hundreds of kids have their lives ruined by leaving school each year. Without them, maybe once every decade, less than a hundred kids will get sick for a few weeks. 

But the problem is also worse than that, because this also plays into a lot of anti-vaxxer rhetoric. A lot of it relies on exploiting people's fears of the government. Mandatory vaccines only make that seem worse. Additionally, it makes these people even less trusting of the government, meaning that they are more likely to shut themselves of from outside streams of information. So it forces many anti-vaxxers into even more of an echo chamber. One of the must successful ways to spread information is to have anti-vaxxers have a friend or a neighbor who can discuss these things with them. The easiest way to prevent that from happening is by forcing them further away from the rest of society.",bayernownz1995,t1_ctdc31l,1437663342,1,t3_3eai2b,3

This is an outcome I hadn't thought of. I'll award a ∆ for a partial view change. This could cause more people to choose to isolate themselves socially or geographically around vaccine-belief lines, which is just bad for everyone in the long run. I still think in the short term it is appropriate to mandate vaccination, but I hadn't thought how it could affect perceptions over time.",facing_the_fallout,t1_cte28zh,1437703870,1,t1_ctdc31l,3
264511,3829_B,"There are a few things presidents, congressional representatives  and senators can do to influence the growth or shrinkage of the economy. Some politicians claim that tax cuts stimulate the economy, others claim that increased government spending (while keeping taxation the same) simulates the economy, but there is no consensus on this point, among economists or politicians. Deficit spending stimulates the economy, but we are already deficit spending, and the national debt is already rather large, so we can't do that forever. Low interest rates stimulate the economy, but elected officials have no direct influence over interest rates -- the Federal Reserve Board does that, and interest rates are already very, very low. New export markets also help, but the U.S. is already committed to several ambitious international trade agreements. Investor confidence helps, a little, maybe, sometimes, but the U.S. stock market is already overpriced. Beyond that, most economic growth comes from increases in productivity, and consumer confidence. Elected officials have no control over these.

If you vote for a candidate who promises to ""create jobs"" or ""grow the economy,"" you're either voting for a liar or a fool. Change my view!

Edit: I'm speaking of the U.S. economy, not the global economy, and I'm speaking of political candidates who might run for office in the near future, not the distant future or the past.

264554,3829_B,"You are in that sense correct that in an economy at capacity, government can usually not produce magic growth (unlike an economy in recession, where government can produce growth).

It can however influence the long term trajectory of growth by strengethening long term market confidence, improving public health, education, produdcing a regulatory enviorment which is friendly to innovation, protecting the economy from large volatility (volatility is generally very costly, for various reasons) or by increasing market effiency (externalities, monopolies etc.).
There are situations were government can easily produce massive frowth (in recessions) and even if not in a recession government regulation can influence long term growth (usually only quite slightly and in a long term). There are even more ways for a government to absolutly wreck an economy.
Ofc in a Pluralistic society it is rather hard for an individual to make a huge difference but I'd argue that you are not correct.

Let's take FDR and the New Deal as an example where the Presidency was the main driver behind the Programm, so it is possible for an individual politician to make a signifcant difference in economic performance (especially in time of crisis).",miribus,t1_ct28b6n,1436829553,2,t3_3d26wz,3

--strengthen long term market confidence?

--improve public health?

--produce a regulatory enviorment which is friendly to innovation?

--protect the economy from large volatility?

--increase market efficiency?

265553,3848_A,"I think your Idea is flawed from the beginning.

1) College/University is an option not mandatory. Add to that, Post Secondary Education is becoming less and less important. I don't think that it will ever go away, but I think the way we look at College is going to change over the next few decades (this is obviously an opinion).

2) Paying for college should be the students responsibility. I did it on my own, just as millions of other have done it. With literally 0 help from my family, because they could not financially afford it. I worked 2 jobs, fixed iPhone's, and studied my ass off to graduate. But I did it. I was financially independent by the time I was 14. My parents haven't paid for anything except a home and food until I was 22 and moved out. I commend any parent that can help their child pay for a higher education. But it's not reasonable to expect a free ride.

The idea that your parents are responsible for paying for your education is misguided and selfish. You should work hard just like your parents did to pay for their educations and everything they have. Don't be lazy, don't expect hand outs, they don't come to you in the real life.

270322,3904_A,"**Update! See Edit #2 below!**

I don't know much about politics. I have a pretty poor understanding of real world economics. I don't follow world events or watch the news. I generally don't bother to keep track of what's going on in the world unless it impacts me directly, or maybe I think there's something meaningful I can do to change it to my own benefit (which has never actually come up).

When it comes to who should be elected in any local, state or federal capacity, or what laws should or should not be passed, I am simply not a qualified to provide input on any level.

So why am I allowed to vote?

Changing my view may require addressing the following positions of mine:

* If one wishes to cast any kind of vote related to government or legislation, one should be required to complete some sort of test to confirm that they understand the subject on which they are voting. This could include acknowledgment of a candidate's qualifications and positions, or the *actual content* of a particular bill. This has the added benefit of rendering wild claims and accusations made by the media, random bloggers, etc. less impactful on the views of the general public. *Note: Regarding this point, I don't want to discuss the specific content of such tests. As a rule, I believe it can be known what is true and what isn't, and so let's assume that the pre-vote tests won't contain personal opinions or interpretations of the subject.*

* If voting is limited to only citizens deemed ""qualified"" by some form of the process described in the previous bullet point, the general outcome is more likely to be better (e.g. the people are more likely to choose a candidate they will still approve of a year later, and there will be less confusion regarding what is contained in proposed bills, etc.).

* The ""right to vote"" should be a privilege that I am not entitled to if I'm not even going to take the time to research the subject.

Change my view by convincing me that, as a 29 year old citizen of the United States of America, I deserve to be able to vote on important matters and issues without doing any research or showing that I understand what I'm voting for/against.

Edit #1: Changed some phrasing.

Edit #2: **IMPORTANT**: The difficulty associated with determining who is qualified to vote and who isn't seems to be the main issue here. I can accept that, and kind of figured this would be the case. I would like to simplify things by clarifying the overall view that I would be interested in changing.

My view is that, assuming we *could* somehow successfully identify qualified individuals for a given subject and restrict the polls to only these people, it would be advantageous to do so at the expense of the (Constitutional?) right to uninformed voting.

In general, I feel that it's justifiable to say that no American citizen should be allowed to cast a vote regarding a subject about which he/she doesn't have a clear and accurate understanding.

I believe that we will never be satisfied with what we have, there will never be equality for all, we'll continue to destroy the environment and in the end, we will all die a much worse death trying to live happily than one that would come form purposefully erasing our existence. Looking at it from another perspective, it's like eradicating the parts of DNA needed to make tonsils so that humans never again deal with tonsillitis. In that analogy, the human body would be the Earth and tonsils would be the people. Tonsillitis would be the possibility of people doing bad things and removing the DNA would be what we do to get rid of humans. I just think that, not taking feelings into account and going with the quickest and simplest option, remove the problems from the root is ideal. Once again, this does not take into account feelings of people as obviously most of us don't want to die, regardless if it would be better for the planet.

Of course, erasing humans from the planet is much simpler than you'd expect. It also doesn't have to be prolonged or painful as would be our deaths from a polluted world and from wars. I am sure that within 50 years, a group could easily genetically engineer a strain of virus to get the job done. Mass production of asbestos and coordinated release all over the world could work too. What I'm saying is that it's pretty easy and could be done quickly. Nothing more, nothing less.

Now, this is all assuming a few things:

- That if humanity continues, we will eventually cease to exist against our will.
- That humanity will never have true equality.
- That war will always continue in some form.
- That we will continue polluting/degrading the Earth as long as we exist.

If each human somehow became the ""God"" of their own universe (though I have no idea how that would come about) then I believe there would be no problem with each individual existence, as controlling your own universe means that no matter what you do you are in the right. Of course, that is all BS/fiction and we live just like all the animals on the Earth, aside from being special in our own little ways. I don't think we as a whole can ever fully agree on anything, and that our disagreements will always cause us problems.

Once again, I believe the destruction of the entire human population to be our best solution.

As an aside, some other animal may eventually evolve to be intelligent in the manner we are, so the possibility of simply destroying all life to forever end suffering of any kind on this planet is considered.

I understand that the conjugation is the only tough part and the whole gender thing might be confusing at first (not that crazy if it ends on an a it's female, except agua which can be both, the only tough part is if it end on an e). Also English is not even the most spoken language in the world where Mandarin is first followed by Spanish. English is rising only because it's commonly being taught as a second language, if you change the language it will also rise.

Also the whole small scale system that English has does not even make sense like why a billion is a thousand of a million where in long scale it's a million of a million.

I know this seems biased like I am arguing that Spanish should be the international language and it's my native language, but it makes more sense if it were. I didn't defend Mandarin because I've always had the impression of it being one of the hardest language to master. If it's otherwise I apologize and anyone who speaks other languages are welcome to support why your language should be the international language.

The most common language used today for programming frontends on the web is Javascript, almost universally agreed to be ""a pretty meh language at best"". Yet it is still dominating its landscape due to historical circumstances. basically meaning the drawbacks of using it do not supersede the benefits of the alternatives.

The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.

Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look! I've created a bookbottle!""

The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.

Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.

Change my view.


EDIT:

Wow, I really didn't see how many gaping holes my argument had. 

What I've learned:

&gt;Short half life

It's short by our human standards, but that means nothing on the universal scale. Our lives are nothing on the scale of the universe, that doesn't mean we aren't alive.

&gt;Very few atoms at a time

This is just a limit on what we're able to synthesize. Massive quantities could theoretically be created in a supernova.

&gt;Not outside the lab.

Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.

There are lots of convincing arguments here, and I'll respond to all of them and delta the ones I feel really swayed me. Thank you for the discussion.",Silent_Sky,t3_3a6sfg,,,ORIGINAL_POST,3
276087,3986_B,"You're expressing a matter of aesthetic philosophy, rather than the rigid formalism of science. In chemistry, an 'element' is any atomic structure, no matter how short-lived or unstable.

Your point of view is understandable from an entirely unscientific perspective, but from a chemist's perspective it's like suggesting that humans who don't make it to adulthood have no place in human records, because they didn't live to a certain popularly accepted arbitrary point, or that food that's only produced in kitchens instead of occurring on its own has no business being called food. And there are in fact people who have those views, so I'm just picking weird ideas out of the air. I chose ones that are really out there, in order to provide a more realistic perspective.

A scientist is unconcerned with whether an element is found in nature or not. What does that even mean? In the decay series of many materials, many transitional elements *do* occur naturally, but don't stick around. Many of the elements that have been synthesized in laboratories *used* to exist naturally, but had short-lives too short to still be around this late in our planet's history. Plenty of elements are forged in the final moments of a star's life, but only last an instant. Do those elements 'exist in nature' or not, and according to whose criteria?

Likewise, how long they last is also arbitrary. A millisecond is tiny for you and me, but it has no aesthetic or qualitative meaning to anything else. We could pick any arbitrary cutoff, but why should we pick any at all? Because some humans might feel better about it? How would that advance the goals of science? And what difference does it make to anyone else? It's not like someone's out there selling these materials for profit.

^2 Just the opposite, presently; the lives of cows are full of pain and discomfort, because our (American) food-raising process is horrifying. I *do* think that this is unethical, just based on the principle that pain is a bad thing, but it's not a massive priority for me because I think the amount of human suffering is significantly greater at this time than the amount of animal suffering (due to the greater capacity of a human to experience suffering).

277432,4011_A,"Since the lives of cattle are unpleasant, on the surface it seems that slaughtering them at an earlier age would minimize suffering and would therefore be less immoral.

The reality of veal however, is that it is essentially a by-product of the dairy industry.  To keep cows lactating they must constantly be producing calves.  Excess male calves are often used for veal rather than raised as steers, or (very rarely) breeding bulls simply because it takes less time and space away from their more profitable mothers.  A dairy cow generally lives about 5 years until it's milk production wanes, while steers raised for meat are only forced to live 18 months or so, and obviously veal calves get to die very quickly.

So while killing baby cows may alleviate more suffering than killing adult cows for food, in practice it is inextricably linked to keeping adult cows alive for food, causing them to suffer far more than they would had they been raised for meat rather than milk.  Add to the fact that many of these calves wouldn't have to be born or suffer at all if not for their essential role in keeping dairy cows lactating.",skunkardump,t1_cs5u7z4,1434254416,7,t3_39rlhg,3

Some facts I've accepted regarding the chopsticks:

&amp;nbsp;

* Exercise fine motor skills

* Give time to taste the food and appreciate it

* Can be used while doing other things

* Are easier to clean, produce and carry

&amp;nbsp;

* Are superior if you want to:
 
 * Preserve the integrity of the food you eat (If you don't want to break a grapevine until it's in your mouth)

 * Eat crusty things (popcorns, cheetos, peanuts...) without dirtying your hands

 * Eat leafs or salad

&amp;nbsp;

* You can have makeshift chopsticks easily while makeshift knifes and forks are still not a thing in 2015.

* Historically better at not stabbing your enemy during dinner?

* Let this be noted, the spoon and the spork were proposed and I'm all in their favors! As for the sporfe, knifoon

288082,4173_A,"This is something that I just have such a hard time understanding.  For years we have been stuck with having cable or satellite subscriptions that are overly priced and force you to pay for large bundles of channels that you might not even want.  Streaming services like Hulu and Netflix have offered a great way to circumvent that process at a much more affordable price and are completely changing the way we view content.

And yet I still see so many people getting so wound up over watching ads on Hulu.  My perception of their argument is this: ""I pay for Hulu, so I shouldn't have to see ads.""  Maybe I'm over-simplifying it, but I just haven't seen any other viable argument that really says anything beyond that.

Now, I should say I definitely understand hating ads.  I live in the city, and I can't walk ten feet out my door without someone trying to sell me something.  We are over-saturated by advertising and it's awful.  Thankfully with more options to block advertising on the internet, it's forcing advertisers to create ads that are more entertaining and feel less obtrusive (although, sometimes it does also force the opposite).

But even though I hate advertising as much as a lot of people do, I still recognize it as a vital part of what makes television work, and since I really like being able to know what happens on my favorite shows every week, I don't get my panties in a twist over it.

I see a lot of people getting wound up who have little understanding of how a service like Hulu works.  I'm certainly not an expert either, but I have an understanding of how the licensing process works and how expensive it can be.  Netflix may be able to get by without ads, but Hulu offers something that Netflix doesn't: content from television that is current and has recently aired.

Netflix usually won't provide new episodes of a show until an entire season is finished.  And even then, it might be a few months until even that happens.  The only current content they do have is their own original programming, which they can get away with because they own the licenses and don't have to pay any licensing fees or performance royalties to any outside production company.

I've seen a lot of my favorite shows on Hulu have episodes be online just hours after it airs on live TV.  Since I dropped cable years ago, this is one of my favorite things about it.  I don't necessarily like that advertising is part of my subscription, but I also realize that Hulu has to license this content from production companies, who have had a history of being apprehensive when it comes to embracing changing technologies.  They are likely charging much higher licensing fees and royalties which means that Hulu in turns has to find other sources of income beyond subscription fees in order to make it work.  Not to mention that the networks themselves probably have their own fees since they probably have exclusivity deals with the production companies who make the programming.

People are so quick to jump to the ""X company is a bunch of greedy corporate whores"" argument without understand the major complexities that go into making a service like Hulu work.  I'm sure Hulu is well aware that their subscribers don't like watching ads.  ""I don't like watching ads"" is even an option in their survey when you cancel your account.  People went on the same tirade when Netflix raised its prices, and I remember thinking the same thing then.

I think that people's displeasure with advertising will ultimately shift services in the direction of removing advertising, but I still think that's a long way off.  Streaming services, despite being around for several years now, are still in their infancy in a lot of ways.  It's going to take a while to allow everyone to adapt and a lot of companies will be resistant to it in the hopes they can retain their old business models.  But I don't see any of this as the fault of Hulu for using advertising.

So my real curiosity here is to find an argument against Hulu's advertising that I haven't seen.  I see so many people upset about it, but I feel like my only understanding of their argument is that they're spoiled and don't want to see ads, which I recognize can be straw-manning on my part.  I'd like to see if someone can shift my bias and provide me some insight I'm not aware of.

EDIT: /u/ceader is the one who ultimately changed my view.  I'm still kind of skeptical about some people's criticisms towards Hulu, but I'm definitely more understanding of why people don't want to pay for ads.

Transgender people don't want to be lumped in with other people with mental illnesses because there is a such a stigma against it. And if society starts treating transgender people as having no mental issue, and accepting invasive surgery as the standard treatment then that will slow research towards less drastic treatments.

Ideally, in the future, if someone were to come into a doctor's office and say ""I feel so bad in my current body that I want hormonal treatment and invasive surgery"" the doctor would be able to prescribe something that would just make the transgender person no longer feel terrible in their current body.

In the past it was believed that gender is a social construct and that your body and society defines your gender. Which is why so many intersexual infants have simply been mutilated (yes, it's a mutilation) and turned into a female (well, only physically anyway).

Same happened to male infants that had a failed circumcision or were simply born with a micro penis. Doctors believed that simply permanently changing their bodies to a female would be better for them than living as a male with a damaged or small penis.

It's like taking a cis/intersex person and making them trans. Which is horrible.

A lot of those people later on have spoken up and said what horrible thing was done to them. It showed that gender is something in your brain that you're born with and not something defined by your body.

Some of those people ended up committing suicide because of what was done to them.

Transition for trans people on the other hand, is like the opposite of the above. It's to alter the body to be in accordance with one's gender (one's mind).

If you, the reader, happens to be a cis male, just look down and think: Do you like your penis? Of course you do. Would you want it to be cut away? Of course not. But why? Well, that's because your brain is programmed that way. Ever wondered why girls are fine with having no penis and males are fine with having one?

For either gender, just look down and think having the wrong bits between your legs. Not such a nice imagination, right?

Imagine getting up tomorrow and suddenly being trapped in the wrong body. Imagine having the wrong bits down there, Imagine having the wrong face, the wrong voice and just the complete body is wrong.

It's the suffering trans people go through every day.

And, the way you're programmed is connected to your gender, your personality and your entire identity, which is why changing your body is less invasive than changing who you are.

So, if you were to get up in the wrong body tomorrow and there was such a pill to change your brain. Would you rather take such a pill, change your whole identity and the way you feel and struggle everyday thinking that ""once it was different"", ""this is not right"" or would you rather go trough the process of getting hormonal treatment, surgery and adjust your body to match who you truly are? Which one sounds more fulfilling and correct?

And even if you would decide to take that pill, and you would be physically and mentally the opposite sex of what you used to be, remember that you don't have any experience in that gender. You'd only know how it used to be and it would be a shock. It just doesn't seem right, does it?

A trans person's mind on the other hand has always been the way it is.

Gender is something in your brain that you're born with.

Changing one's body to the opposite of one's mind is absolutely terrible, just as is leaving a person born in the wrong body with the body they have.

Changing one's mind to the opposite sex of what it is, is just as terrible, for everyone. No matter whether you're cis, trans or intersexed.

290308,4205_A,"I just watched *The Imitation Game* (2014). Entertaining film, I enjoyed it ... until, as I usually do after watching a film, I went and read up about it. I was pretty annoyed to discover that [aspects of the film's plot were warped for the purpose of making it more dramatic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Imitation_Game#Accuracy). I do not think any good comes of this, and to be honest it makes me quite mad. For example, in the film, the main character Alan Turing is portrayed by the actor as obviously autistic to some extent, but according to a quote on Wikipedia (not sure exactly who said it) ""the Asperger's-like traits portrayed in the film ... bear little relationship to the actual adult Turing"". This, I think, is insulting to Turing's memory, to customise his personality as to make the film more interesting or to make the audience more sympathetic towards his character.

Sometimes it's less minor than character modification. I distinctly remember watching *13 Days* (2000) in a high school history class to supplement our Cold War study. This film ramped up the 'Soviets are evil and JFK is a god' theme to the point of including an entirely fictional battle scene, but went out of its way to present itself as a historically accurate film, including real Cold War footage throughout. We watched it in history class for god's sake! It's also been criticised for attributing a major role in the end of the Cuban Missile Crisis to Kenneth O'Donnell - somebody who was *actually there* argues that ""For God's sakes, Kenny O'Donnell didn't have any role whatsoever ... that's absurd."" I think overblowing or underplaying real people's roles in history is just insulting, and cannot be justified.

Thus, **I am suggesting that films which are 'based on a true story' should not be produced, unless historians can guarantee that they are a valid representation of what actually occurred.**

I will pre-argue some anticipated arguments in advance:

* ""They're claiming to be *based* on a true story, not perfectly historically accurate."" 

Yes, but these films spread misinformation all the same. People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films *appear* as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can). It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

* ""The aim of a film is to entertain, it is not meant to be a history lesson.""

But to some extent, they are taken as such all the same. A person who knows *absolutely nothing* about JFK will undoubtedly feel at least somewhat more knowledgable after sitting down and watching *JFK* (1991). And you know what, they *should* feel more knowledgable, because parts of the film are correct. But other parts and hopelessly wrong.

* ""It would be boring if we saw films about the events as they actually happened.""

Suck it up. If you want to learn history, watch a documentary. If you want action, watch Avengers. Don't ever watch *Pearl Harbour* (2001). A quote from Wikipedia regarding that film: 'the producer Jerry Bruckheimer was quoted saying, ""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Okay, I think I've ranted (more than) enough. I need to stop raging about so many movies (don't even get me started on *Pocahontas* (1995) and *Argo* (2012)) - please CMV!

**EDIT: Great chatting everyone! Bad history will still annoy me forevermore, but nonetheless my view has been Changed! The most convincing arguments for me were that it would be incredibly difficult to draw the line between what is minor enough that the director has artistic license and what isn't, and that ALL secondary sources of history are a matter of perspective and interpretation anyway, as well as many other valuable and insightful arguments. Thanks for playing!**

290333,4205_A,"I sympathize with your frustrations, but I'm not sure I agree we need to start banning movies. A few points:



&gt; It should not be the audience's task to read up on what really happened and what the writer made up for fun.

Actually, it really should. In any capacity. We should not be in the business of encouraging people to swallow stories wholesale, whether they find them in the theater, on the internet, in a book, or in the paper. If you are endeavouring to discover the ""true story"", you should already be looking at multiple sources. This isn't even a difficult thing to do - you managed to do it with a quick wikipedia search.



&gt;People take 'based on truth' to mean 'mostly truth', especially when filmmakers go to an effort to make their films appear as historically accurate as possible (eg. including real dates/events/quotes and making the actors look as much like the real people as they can).

How someone interprets the word ""based"" is not the responsibility of the filmmaker. All the simulacrum in the world does not change basic definitions.



&gt; If you want to learn history, want a documentary.

While it's true that documentaries are often held to a higher standard than historical films, this does not make them infallible. A lot of what passes under the genre of ""documentary"" is heavily biased, or even outright doctored. Films do you the courtesy of letting you know they are fabricated, whereas any fabrication in documentaries is presented as unvarnished truth. Should we ban documentaries too?  



&gt;""We tried to be accurate, but it's certainly not meant to be a history lesson"".' This infuriates me. What was the purpose of making a film about Pearl Harbour if you weren't going to do it properly?

Because people are interested in history, but they are also interested in the human condition, and how people relate to one another. Sometimes, they would prefer this to historical accuracy. Pearl Harbour's main purpose was to tell a story of love in a time of war - the focus was on human drama, and not historical accuracy. It's perfectly fine to criticize them about this, but why would you get outraged over Bruckheimer being honest about his intentions? He *should* be coming forward to clarify that history is his backdrop and not his subject. I'd be more infuriated if he was *not* up front about this. 




I'm not going to say that people can't be easily misled, because they certainly can. But what is the alternative? 100% accuracy in all things? In many historical cases we can't even form a working consensus on what happened, or for what reason - that doesn't eliminate the ancient drive to tell stories about our history. If filmmakers want to be as accurate as possible they can - the Band of Brothers series comes to mind. But if they would prefer not to, and are happy to tell us that they are not even trying, what's the problem?",graciegraciegracie,t1_crb93o7,1431806484,1,t3_366935,2
290934,4223_A,"CMV: ISIS isn't about the US, it isn't about Bush or Obama. ISIS was created because of internal forces within the gigantic Islamic world. It isn't about us, and to think it is is just arrogent and self centered lazy thinking.


I hear lots of people arguing that it is the actions of X or Y president that caused ISIS to exist, but I think the internal ideologies and economic, cultural an political forces within the middle east are much more significant than anything the US did, even the US invasion, or whatever the US did or didn't do afterward may have only slowed or hastened such an explosion in the middle east for a few years.

290944,4223_A,"Okay, personally I find it more arrogant to suggest that the actions of our government have no effect on other nations. We have the largest military in the history of the world, by far. There are U.S. military bases all over. Have you ever seen War of the Worlds? Despite what you may think of that movie, imagine the humans in that movie are the people of the middle east, and the U.S. is the aliens. When you fuck with the way other countries operate, they get pissed.",FingerTipTapDancer,t1_cr9fc4y,1431648720,1,t3_35zi4m,2
292884,4253_B,"Not really an opinion so much as a prediction, but its still a view i hold.  My prediction is based on a number of factors and you can address any or all of them or bring up new issues I haven't thought of.  

1) Unpopular: The draft for the war in Vietnam was extremely unpopular with massive protests and draft dodging.  After the draft was eliminated the protests died down even as the war continued.  It seems that America will support a lot of military activity (Iraq War 1 &amp; 2, Afghanistan, etc) as long as they are not personally forced to serve.  

2) No close border crisis: Other modern developed countries have forced selective service (South Korea, Israel) but usually these countries face bordering existential crises to their very existence.  America does not have this, has not ever had this, and presumably will not ever have this and so there is no need to have millions of men and women be conscripted every year for a tour of duty.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conscription

3) Nuclear Weapons: America may face small attacks here and there but no nation state large enough to possibly overthrow the United States government seems likely to attack for fear of nuclear weapons retaliation.  While 9/11 was a tragedy, there was no hope of terrorists taking over the country or overthrowing the government.  The only world forces strong enough to do this would be large nations with large militaries of their own and if they did have a mainland ground force invasion of US soil it would almost guarantee a nuclear response.

4) Women, and the out of shape:  This is a minor reason but none the less I'll bring it up for discussion.  In a modern draft there would be seemingly no way for women to avoid serving.  Currently women face demanding physical aptitude tests to qualify for the most demanding positions or in some cases are barred from service for fear they will not be able to handle the physical requirements of the job (front line combat, Navy Seals, etc).  In the 21st century when men and women have equal rights and are largely treated equally there would be pushback if those less capable of serving were thought to be more likely to get an easier or safer assignment.  This would create a race to the bottom for applicants seeking to avoid dangerous duty.  Furthermore the vast majority of Americans are overweight, out of shape, and would require extensive training to become combat ready.  If diabetes, heart conditions, obesity, or any number of conditions would disqualify a person from service I imagine people would quickly engage in unhealthy habits (or bribe doctors) in order to avoid service. 

5) Conscientious objectors: In previous generations there was a much stronger sense of duty, warrior culture, and sense of imminent danger which cultivated a value in service.  In the modern world, where people increasingly distrust their government, have more access to information, and are more likely to have diverse religious and philosophical views I do not see the public getting behind any major military involvement that would require a draft.  I would imagine there would be a rush to qualify yourself as a conscientious objector to the war in order to avoid combat even if that individual didn't feel that way immediately prior to the draft.  

Please change my view!",EconomistMagazine,t3_35gi8x,,,ORIGINAL_POST,3
292916,4253_B,"On your Point 3 (Nukes):  We will have, in the next 50 years, the ability to defeat ICBM's.  It is not unthinkable that China, Russia and India will also have this ability.  In fact, I would go so far as to say that any warhead capable of delivering a nuke (at present sizes) will be able to be defeated prior to detonation.  Whether this is due to anti-missile shields, laser technology or targeted EMP's, it does not matter.  Once nukes are a non-factor, the single largest strategic problem with going to war with another country is gone.  States that don't have to worry about their interests being nuked are much more likely to send the ground troops in.

On your point 4 (Women and the Out of Shape):  I see no reason that our current health problems will stop us from drafting people.  The training may be longer and more involved, but where their is a requirement, there is a way in the US Military.  As for women, I look forward to the day women are eligible for the draft.  But just because they are drafted does not mean they will be automatically able or fit to do all jobs.  They will be assigned to the jobs that they can do well at.

On point 5 (CO's):  You have to prove your CO status.  This has always been true.  Access to info will only make people more ready for it.  But if 5-10 more people out ov every 1000 do qualify, you still have 990.  You can play with those numbers, but I am not convinced that this is a problem that will completely negate the benefit a government would get out of a draft.",Techsanlobo,t1_cr4s724,1431292587,1,t3_35gi8x,3
292917,4253_B,"Point 5: What proof is typically needed?  How antiquated is that system?  Whatever it is I think it would be too strict for modern tastes.  Granted the state could always ignore CO status but not without consequences.

Point 4: ""They will be assigned to the jobs that they can do well at.""  I think if this job assignment is equally spread out amongst the involuntarily assigned dangerous jobs then people will be fine with it.  If they get preferential treatment to easier positions that soldiers want then there will be major problems.  

Point 3: &amp;#8710;  I'll delta everyone that brought up the ability to counter nuclear weapons and specifically ICBMs.  Ballistic Missile Defense is already a reality in certain respects and this will only become easier to do in the future.  I think submarine delivered nuclear will remain a threat much longer than ballistic missiles but its possible that this could be countered as well.

If nuclear weapons are no longer the last and ultimate line of security I fear for the world.  I hate proxy wars probably more than most, but without the threat of mutually assured destruction I think WW3 won't be far off.  ",EconomistMagazine,t1_cr6atcv,1431411583,1,t1_cr4s724,3
