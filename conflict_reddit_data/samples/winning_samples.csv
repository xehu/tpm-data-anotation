The corruption and lack of transparency created by PACs and SuperPACs and Citizens United in general is definitely a major problem, but like some other things that have come up in this discussion, it's not an issue that makes the USA an un-democratic state. There's no rule saying that the person who raises the most money wins the election.

I would like to see the counter argument to my view(s) so that I can objectively reanalyze my stance on them and decide if I still feel this way.  I was referred here by another poster and I've read through the rules and it seems like the perfect sub for a good debate :).  That being said:

I don't understand why it's inappropriate to use profanity or even for children to be exposed to or even use profanity.  ""Swear words"" are literally just words, and most of them are considered slang or profanity since they originated from the Anglo-Saxon words.  I do not allow my children to swear, but every time that I tell them not to I feel like a hypocrite.  The only reasons I don't allow them to swear is because I don't want them to get into the habit, then let a swear word slip at school and end up in trouble.  Society seems to really look down on children using profanity, so I also don't want an investigation from DCF or anything like that.

I understand that some people find them offensive from a religious standpoint, but as a non religious person myself, this doesn't apply to me and I don't feel like it's a good ""anti-profanity argument"" since it doesn't coincide with my morality.  My moral code is simple: does this action harm another individual in some way?  If so, analyze the action and determine if the fault lies in the action or the person being harmed by it.  Someone taking offense to profanity falls in the category of ""just because you're offended doesn't make you right.""  Change my view?

12942,177_B,"I first learned about evolution as a young child.  My father immediately informed me that evolution was false for religious reasons.  My entire analysis of evolution has been based on the idea that macroevolution is false.  With this in mind, after discussing Darwin and evolution at a high school level, I formulated a view that I still hold to this day.  Evolution occurs on small scales with species, but these species do not hold a common ancestor.  I cannot say for certain how many species of birds existed at the beginning, but I certainly accept that there are more species now, because species adapt and natural selection takes hold.  I do not believe; however, that humans are direct descendents of any species, and I do not believe that birds and dogs (for example) had any common ancestor.  In forming this belief, I have rejected certain levels of scientific consensus, but I have never rejected any information that I felt refuted this.  

In any case, what I am looking for are examples that prove that a dog may have had the same ancestor as a bird (or something along those lines).  I am not looking for the only facts that I have been offered (that finches in the Galapagos developed different beaks).

To be clear, it is not a question of guilt that the Grand Jury should be answering, it is a questions of whether they are 100% sure that what has happened breached no laws.

14865,204_B,"&gt; This is enough confusion to require a trial, and it doesn't matter from the perspective of the Grand Jury what the outcome would be, it should still be requiring a trial.
The confusion is one of the major issues at hand here. An indictment is issued when the grand jury determines probable cause. It doesn't have to be unanimous, only a supermajority of 2/3 or 3/4. But it was. That means all 12 people agreed that the immense conflict in testimony, combined with the forensic evidence, meant that it was more likely than not that Wilson did not commit the crime. Furthermore, the perspective of the outcome really does matter. Probable cause really isn't a difficult standard to meet. Beyond reasonable doubt, however, is much more difficult. In other words, if the Grand Jury determines that probable cause cannot be met, then beyond reasonable doubt cannot be met either. There is no guarantee of conviction even if the indictment is issued. ""Confusion"" in the testimony does not supersede the evidence. The grand jury's determining that probable cause could not be met means that prosecuting the case is a waste of resources, and also not how the law works.",Dont_Quote_Me_On_It,t1_cme8uee_1,1417065239.0,36.0,t3_2njpov,3

Your explanation seems to be the best one so far and did change my mind a bit. So is there an appeal process or a deferral process they can use in cases where more evidence comes to light? ",skinbearxett,t1_cme9e8k,1417066738.0,7.0,t1_cme8uee,3
16331,223_B,"I'd like to think I am a pretty logical and progressive person. However. This open relationship thing has started to come up more and more in my dating life and it sounds like simple bullshit to me. I don't see how you can have a meaningful, healthy and truly intimate connection with someone if there is a chance that someone else can 'be' with your significant other in that way. 

Now, I am not jealous or insecure when it comes to my relationships but I think that emotionally and definitely physically the connection to one person comes from being with that one person. Not that one person on Thursday, I can still get that other person's number Friday and if I feel like hopping in the bed with someone else that Sunday it's fine. On the flipside I totally respect their honesty about not being monogamous instead of cheating on someone unknowing. 

Change my view. Or at least help me to see the POV more clearly of those that believe in open relationships.

EDIT: Okay...thanks to everyone that shared their experiences and opinions on this topic. I learned A TON! I can totally say that I can accept that there are people that the poly life simply 'works for' and for others it doesn't. Thanks to everyone that was super transparent sharing their ups and downs.

To the people that were kind of a dick I expected you here and there were so few so I still feel good about asking how and what I asked.

I will reply more limited to those that still choose to comment but thanks because I not only understand the POV I must say I suppose I have actually changed my view. :)

TL;DR: I think open relationships are bullshit CMV
EDIT: My view was changed.

19973,263_A,"Ok, so i've been thinking about this idea for quite a long time. And i really think it's unethical, or at least something is wrong about this view i have. So that's why i'm here.

I deeply believe that not everybody should be allowed to vote, and let me explain why.
Here in the Netherlands(i think it's not an unique situation) we have this political party and let's just say i believe they are not here to make things better. They are publicly being negative about immigrants. You all probably know these kind of parties.
And they are getting quite popularhere.

And i think it would be really bad to have these kind of parties in charge. And yes you might say:  ""well that's your opinion, people should be allowed to vote who they want right?"". And i wouldn't have a problem with that if they actually knew what they were voting for. But they just don't bother to read into their campaign points etc. I see this time and time again when you ask the people who vote for them why they are voting for them. ""Well this party has some good points about immigrants right? They make a mess out of our country right? "" and it annoys me a whole lot that they can't name actual points of agenda. 

So how do you want to make this selection of voters you ask?
I don't think it should be based on intellegence, wealth or something like that.
But i do think that if people had to make a test at the voting room, to check if they really know what they are voting for. ""Name 5 points of agenda from the party you are voting for"". It would really would help.

I hesitated a lot to post this, because i'm more of a lurker and my English isn't that great. But i really want this view to be changed because i know total democracy should be better in theory. And i walked with this idea for quite a while now. 

Reddit Please change my view!

19993,263_A,"Well, first of it sounds like this would be very, very inpractical. - how many people vote in the Netherlands? I found a source that says it's over 9 million people.
Ok, so you want to test them all. - at the voting booth just before they can vote, too. There are three ways to do that:",misfit_hog,t1_clzow1h_1,1415737571.0,1.0,t3_2lzrmg,7
19993,263_A,"*a) oral test: fair in some ways, because some people have the right knowledge of what they think their party stands for, but problems with the buzz words. They can explain it to another person, taking all the time they need.  - drawbacks:   1. you need people, volunteers or paid, just to listen in. If you want to get voting done soon and not over, say, at least a week, you need lots of those people. 2. Said people need to be knowledgeable on various parties, so experts. 3. They need to be unbiased. In many ways! They need to accept a person's view they find bad, if it aligns with the party the person wants to vote for. They need to not let friends/family /people they like get through easy. Etc.",misfit_hog,t1_clzow1h_2,1415737571.0,1.0,t3_2lzrmg,7
19993,263_A,"*b) written text: can be done in a booth with the voting and later on worked through by experts to decide if vote is accepted. Get's voters out of booth fastest. - drawbacks: 1. Some people who know what they want to say suck at writing it down. Other people just are not good with tests. Others again have atrocious handwriting. 2. You still need experts going through that. The tine it costs till voting a are counted, the man power needed ( and probably wages paid) etc. just shifts from ""before voting"" to ""after voting"". 3. To make this faster people might look for ""buzzwords"" given out by the parties. In which case they could overlook voters points, which are right, but differently worded ( it has happened in test markings, at school, now imagine it at bigger scale) 4. A person who votes will never know if there vote was accepted, thus maybe making voters less likely to vote as they worry that they are not in control anyway. - sending out letters with information of ""vote accepted/not accepted"" might cost more time, manpower and money.",misfit_hog,t1_clzow1h_3,1415737571.0,1.0,t3_2lzrmg,7
19993,263_A,"*c) multi choice tests: every party supplies a certain amount of questions. Everybody expects that a voter knows, say, 80% of the answers. A voter is asked to  "" fill out those items which fit your party"" ( or similar, better wording). Those might be fed through a computer, which knows if Peter voted for party x, questions 1, 4, 7, 10, 11, 19, 20... Should have been filled in, too. Less man power and time is needed than in the other possibilities. - drawbacks: 1. The pencil did not leave a dark enough mark. Peter filled in question 8, but then erased it. The computer can not read this... At my university there is always a certain percentage of multi choice tests that need human working in the end. I expect the same with voting. So you still need people who go through everything. Less people, but still more ( and more time) than counting votes needs right now. 2. The wording of some questions is confusing or two different parties have the same agenda in One point, but word it differently. Peter clicks the wording of part y instead of party x. This can be avoided by so embody young through the questions the parties sent in and merging similar answers, which then are accepted for both parties. Some extra work on part of government, but not too much. 3. Being aware what the party stands for, but not the words they use. In free writing or talking you might get that point across, in multi choice questions you might be lost. 4. Parties trying to avoid point three and sending in incredibly simple questions. Every voter gets them right, but they show no deeper understanding. This would defeat the purpose of the test. 5. Sone parties doing number three, some number four. This now means a disproportional amount of voters get accepted for being voters for party y over voters for party x. - some people WILL spin this as ""party x voters are uneducated snd don't even know what their party stands for"" .",misfit_hog,t1_clzow1h_4,1415737571.0,1.0,t3_2lzrmg,7

19994,263_A,"Altough i do think you are quite right, that it's really impractical, i still think it's possible. Which way actually would work is not really clear to me(my best bet would be a slight alteration of C). But i think like every important system it should be tested anyways and something like that takes a lot of time and effort. I'm not an expert in questionares or other examples in that area. So i think it's hard to say that it is impossible at the moment. And if you are right about it being very impractical, who knows what the future will bring in terms of technology.

21348,287_B,"Now I'm not saying that actors are not talented and that it is not difficult to act out difficult scenes. My qualm is with the separation of ""good actors"" and ""average actors"".

Matthew McConnahey is the obvious candidate who was thought of as nothing special until he had an opportunity to work with a good script, good production and good directing. Heath Ledger was another example. Robin Williams, too, would not have been thought as much more than a comedian until given the right opportunity. Or Will Smith. We may soon be saying the same for Jesse Eisenberg.

Given the quality of script, the careful directing, the number of takes and feedback and cues an actor may take to get a scene right, the music which can be an emotional trigger; it is hard to imagine any professional actor who could not be coaxed into giving stellar performances.

Obviously people will cite examples to the contrary, but to compare Gary Oldman who is widely regarded as a master actor, I've recently noticed the previously unremarkable aussie actor Joel Edgerton being cast as Rameses in the upcoming Exodus, and I think that it may not take much to make a competent actor ""chameleonic"".

Basically, I believe any competent or trained actor can be coaxed to give outstanding performances with the right directing and production. There is less variety in the capabilities of professional actors than the fandom of A-listers suggest.

Edit: to clarify my position: I think there is less validity to the claim ""X is a brilliant actor and Y is a bad or average actor"" than  there is to ""X got a good role, script and director whilst Y has been unable to find a role or script he can really shine in.""

Edit2: okay guys, took a bit of discussion but you did change my view. A few guys highlighted the inverse of my position, good movies dragged down by bad acting (Keanu in Dracula is one I'll never forgive) and average movies saved by an outstanding performance (no one would be mentioning Good Morning Vietnam without Williams). But most importantly was the talk of theater, which removes all of my talk of takes, editing and music and lets it be the bare actors.

21666,290_B,"First off, I want this to be USA-specific, simply because it is the only government I have lived under, maybe if there is some really good counterpoint with another nation I would hear it, but I am mainly looking for answers related to the US government.   

Okay, I'm not suggesting the removal of government, let's get that out first.  I know that the *real* purpose of a government is to protect certain values that a society believes are rights of the citizens (it is the government's job to ensure that the food is safe, or that some random business allows for equal opportunity) - I understand that.  

**Here's my general point.**  There is not a single example of a government organization working with greater efficiency than a corporate or private-sector competitor.  This could be post office/UPS (the post office in USA loses tons of money, has too many stores, etc.), public works for cities VS independent salting/road repair companies, or even the entirety of the US military VS Blackwater (Blackwater never had a single failed mission in Iraq).  These are just some examples I can think of at the moment, but it seems like every time the government attempts to provide a material, money-handling service, they do a very poor job at keeping it efficient.  And to juxtapose their inefficiency, there are corporations working in the exact same sectors making lots of money (USPS vs UPS).


Here is a good example of what I think would better serve the nation.  Instead of having the TSA at every airport harassing your grandmother because their inept ability to identify, why shouldn't the government just publish a certain set of standards that need to be met by each airport security checkpoint, then each airport hires a private security firm?  Then, the only job of the government is to inspect the private security to ensure they are meeting the measures.  

I hope this gave enough background to what I was trying to say, and yes I kind of want to keep this US-specific, at least at first.


Edit:

I read through all or almost all of these and I enjoyed most.  I think I gave out 2 deltas.  One proved my point wrong very pragmatically with a literal real world circumstance.  Another points out that my condition that the government is in an industry to make money is flawed and the reality is that they are there to operate it in the way that they see fit.  This made me reconsider my original post, and change my view point, so I awarder a delta for that.

24427,335_B,"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model  
I believe the free market combined with a social safety net reduces poverty which benefits everyone. High level of education, highly efficient administration effectively invests into the society, providing multiple incentives and angles of growth.  

People have trust in their government, in their administration and how their taxes are used. This leads to a high level of security; problems are laid off them and ultimately this leads to a high level of happiness.   

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Happiness_Report  

Low level of income inequality, high GDP and PPP per capita, liberal laws, low crime, low corruption, good healthcare, great education, low pollution. What's not to like?  

But all this does not obstruct high profit businesses from investing and all that is asked from businesses is that they treat their employees with respect and pay them enough so they can make a decent living. True, most thrift-based businesses would be discouraged from investing but Imo in the developed country there should be no place for such an exploiting business style.  

My only doubt is whether such a model could adapt to a larger country because in all Nordic cases we deal with low populations, large areas and often, decent levels of natural resources and admittedly this does create conditions for easier administration and sustainable economic growth.

32872,460_B,"Okay, so I know that this is going to be unpopular but here goes. As the title says, I don’t see anything wrong with going to a restaurant, right before they close, and ordering a full meal. If a restaurant’s policy is to seat people up until closing, then I have no problem with it, and I will demand the same level of service that I would get in the middle of the day.

If a restaurant stops seating an hour or so before closing, so that their staff gets out at a certain time, then I totally get that, but if they close at 10pm and they choose to seat me at 9:55pm, then I’m going to take as long as I normally would and not rush through dinner. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Reason For This View**: Last week, a group of friends and I were on the way home from a football game, and we wanted to get something to eat. So we stopped by a restaurant that closed at 11pm; it was around 10:45pm, so I went in and asked if they were still open- they said yes. They asked how many there would be and I told them 12. They said “*No problem*”, so we went in. 

The servers had an attitude right from the start and as we were sitting down, they tried to tell us that only certain things were available because the kitchen was already shut down. I told them that that wasn’t okay, and that we weren’t going to order off of a partial menu, and if the whole menu wasn’t available, we’d leave.


A manager heard me and saw us getting ready to split, so she came over and said that the whole menu was available and that we could order whatever we liked. So we did. It was close to 1:30 am before we finally got out of there. 

I personally see nothing wrong with this so Reddit, CMV.

35025,500_A,"I've just watched this [collegehumor video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdyin6uipy4) about racism. Yeah it Collegehumor but it clearly has a serious intention. It's very short but the point I'm focusing on here is at 0:16.

**DISCLAIMER**

Now I'm from Europe and where I live (quite a small village) we simply don't have and therefore don't know most of these issues (at least not to that extend). Infact, most of us are white. Many muslims (especially Turkish) but they don't stand out that much either. So it this offends you - be considerate and think about being in my shoes, with a different society. 
Browsing through reddit I noticed oftentimes that remarks that immediately sound racist to americans are perceived very neutrally here. We do have foreigners, being from Italian descent I'm a foreigner in Germany myself but I don't look that much different to Germans. Yet sometimes I get asked if I run a pizza-shop just because I'm Italian and many Italians actually do have a restaurant or sell ice cream or something like that. That is not considerate to be racist or offensive here. But I'm here to hear you out, from a US perspective. 

**END OF DISCLAIMER**

Anyway, I was surprised at some of the examples in the video. I know it's the point to show people that they're being racist while not even realizing it. I get it. 

But I have a hard time seeing whats wrong about excluding a race in your sexual preference. 
Now **if** the argument is that it's racist because I'm actually making a difference depending on the race then why is it OK to be sexist (making a difference on gender)? 

If the argument to that is ""Well you didn't choose to like women / men but you choose to dislike a race"" then wouldn't we start to ride a social-justice-rollercoaster that would continue on to other minorities, traits or features? Not OK to dislike dating Redheads? Not OK to dislike dating elderly people? Not OK to dislike dating handicapped people? Until we get to our final destination that sounds like *you just don't wanna date her because she's ugly! You're discriminating ugly people.*

Maybe you say it's racist because such a statement would express that I think all e.g. black people share a common trait while they don't necessarily have to - meaning it's racist to pigeonhole an entire race. But then again, what's the deal with doing so? For all that matters the term ""asian"", ""black"", ""hispanic"" is putting people into drawers already, so that's racist already, no? 

Again, I hope not to offend anyone. After all I might be just somewhat ignorant because I don't live in a diverse society like the US. Maybe I'm missing what exactly is the taboo here. Maybe it's just taboo to say it but it's ok to think like that?? I don't know. But doing a little research I also found this asian girl to call herself racist because she refuses to[ date guys of her own race](http://www.xojane.com/it-happened-to-me/asian-woman-dating-asian-men-jenny-an).

I just think that IF we call this racist and put the blame here onto people not wanting to date a certain race, then we would start blaming people to be discriminating others for every aspect, watering our preferences down until we truly like everyone equally. 

Note, my point isn't so much ""this isn't racist"" but more the issue that resolves out of blaming people for their sexual preference, even if it comes to someone never wanting to date a certain race. 

So I'm genuinely curious, this is my first post on /r/changemyview and I'm open for a new opinion if you could explain me:

- Why should it be called racist to refuse to date a certain race given my arguments above
- If it is racist, why wouldn't we end up blaming people for refusing to date gingers / elder / or just ugly people? 
And finally
- Aren't we all entitled to any of our sexual preferences without needing to justify them?

EDIT: Sorry for my poor english, I guess pre-judgement is more fitting word than prejudice. 

EDIT2: I should point out I'm not refusing to date any race. I'm just genuinely interested in the criticism people face for doing so.

35064,500_A,"So for me there are a few issues.
The biggest thing would be why you aren't attracted to a black person, white person, etc?

My second issue is that we should be attracted to whole people.  It is fine to be attracted to specific traits of course, and certainly preferences will happen, but frankly the chances of you finding someone who matches each and every preference in terms of all their traits is slim to none.  I know for myself I love women with certain kinds of hair, and I don't think I've ever dated a woman who has it.

For instance I don't think I've mentioned to anyone that I like black skin and I wouldn't have if it didn't serve as a point.

Thats a big issue I'm having. I think race in dating shouldn't be a touchy topic. Maybe I'm looking too much for that post-racism world that doesn't exist yet (probably never).

I can't talk for a person that feels that way.. so I don't know. But I feel whatever the reason may be that one person feels that way, he / she should be entitled to do so.

39936,581_A,"So I was reading in a manga where one person has control over ice and can well it into existence whenever they want (I am avoiding giving the same since I don't know how to spoiler tag and I don't want to give the name away since it's a big deal later) eventually the person develops the ability to freeze time for about 10 or so minutes. This development got me thinking since a lot of people I know think that being able to control fire is (no pun intended) hot shit I Began to think that controlling ice would be much better; reasons ?



Ice only needs water or any liquid to be made so as long as I have anything that has any liquid at on such as nearly every place on earth I can make ice, this is not the same with fire which needs oxygen so If I froze the person in a very compact ice shell the person wouldn't be able to create fire since they would waste all the oxygen and I would just keep reinforcing the shell so 1v1 the ice wins

Second profit: I can freeze time and walk into a bank freeze the vault and then sledgehammer bam no vault door I would be able to see all the lasers due to the mist from the ice so I can dodge lasers and bam I am a billionaire who did it with style. 


Third I would never pay for gas or ships or anything since I can freeze everything I would just sit down in my nice comfortable chair and have an ice dragon which I would make(it's no alive but it pushes me) to take me anywhere.


4th I would be amazing at places where people want cold or cooler temperature If I see a very attractive girl saying gosh I wish it was colder BAM ice man over here I can do that for you and chill the area down like 15 or so degrees that's a guaranteed hello at least also your cooler ran out of ice don't worry BAM cold beers, who is the savior of the alcohol this guy. 


5th personal use: since I would be controlling it I would get used to cold temperatures so when it gets cold to winter guess who gets to go outside shirtless and in shorts since I would be used to the cold

40724,588_B,"First of all, let me be clear that this is not some 'speak 'murican', anti-immigrant screed. Multiculturalism is the way of the world, and I'm all for it. Plus, immigrants bring fresh ideas (and delicious food). Not to mention that English is an insanely difficult language even for native speakers, so I'm not going to begrudge people for speaking it with an accent.

What I do have a problem with is people who speak English fluently and with an American accent suddenly lapsing into another accent to say a specific word. This mainly arises with Latinos using identity markers ('latino', 'chicano') or foods ('quesadilla'). However, most of these words have been adopted into English as true loanwords; English speakers understand them and use them often. But I often hear people on the news, e.g. a policy analyst of Latin-American extraction, using words like ""latino"" with a Spanish lilt that sounds (to me) out-of-place and exaggerated.

Suddenly switching to another accent, at best, is confusing, as it takes the listener's brain that extra millisecond to adapt to a new style of speaking. At worst, it sounds kind of pretentious and exclusionary.

I'm not arguing that we should completely anglify these words -- I don't want to hear someone pronounce 'quesadilla' with a hard L sound, like the grandma in Napoleon Dynamite. Rather I think we should treat Spanish loanwords like we do words like ""kindergarden"" (German), ""sake"" (Japanese), or ""joie de vivre"" (French) -- try as best we can to respect the original pronunciation, but maintain our typical accent when saying them.

Doing otherwise is just kind of disrespectful. To illustrate: I am a reasonably proficient Spanish speaker and have spent a lot of time in Spanish-speaking countries. Once I was speaking with a local (edit: in Spanish) and used the word ""iPod"", which left him scratching his head. I couldn't figure out why -- I knew, in fact, that he owned one too. Then it hit me -- I was pronouncing the 'i' sound like the English ""eye"", which is a confusing sound for Spanish speakers, especially when surrounded by Spanish words. Once I pronounced it as ""ee-Pod"", he immediately knew what I was talking about. From then on, when speaking Spanish, I always try to 'spanishify' the pronunciation of vowel sounds to avoid these kind of misunderstandings.

So CMV.

On the other hand, French words and phrases like ""raison d'être"" are *not* loanwords but actual French words and should be pronounced in French -- perhaps not with an exaggerated Parisian accent, but with the right French phonemes emulated in English -- perhaps with the American R rather than the French R, but still with the French vowels.",xiipaoc,t1_ckabepp_1,1409960662.0,3.0,t3_2fkhgs,6

42084,612_B,"As we all know, on August 31st, some hacker released nude photos of tons of female celebrities, and also saying that there are more nude photos to come. Just about everybody believes this to be an insane breach of privacy, with Jennifer Lawerence's PR going as far to threaten to [prosecute those who post the images](https://twitter.com/JLdaily/status/506222240375902208). Others have gone on to say that [those who view the photos shouldn't complain about the NSA or privacy](http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2014/09/opinion-lets-make-a-deal-about-those-jennifer-lawrence-nude-photos-ok/).

My view is that there are a couple things wrong with this. Firstly, the distinction between private and public. To me, something is private when it's ownership belongs to an exclusive group of people. In this case, the group was the photo takers and whoever they shared those photos with (Apple not withstanding). When the hacker obtained the photos and released them to the public, the group was non-exclusive, now anybody who has access to a computer can view the photos, and thus the photos aren't private, they're public. Ideally, those photos should belong to the photo takers, and thus those who spread the photos are spreading ownership and making them more public, which is wrong. *I'd like to remind everyone I don't think what the hacker and those who share the images are right.* 

Now that the photos are public, it's not a matter of privacy to view the photos. I can still be mad at the NSA for breaching my privacy, however, if the NSA made my information or others public, *I could not be mad at them for solely looking at it, as long as they didn't do anything with the information.* I would still be mad at the NSA, as I am with the hacker, however, unlike my private information, you can't use the leaked pictures to hack into my bank account, or find out where I live, or find out where I go to school.

With that said, I'd like like to make my points a little clearer for easier view changing:

* What the hacker and the people who spread the images do are wrong.
* It's perfectly ok to view the photos.
* You're not a hypocrite if you view those photos and dislike the NSA.

For several thousand years it has been the duty of clergy and religious institutions to formalize monogamous relationships into marriage, which is still the case in several countries. Only recently, with the advent of supra-religious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue.


It wasn't something that people only started doing after someone voted for a law to bureaucratize it, but the other way round: it was something that was good, and only then did states decide to appropriate it for their own sake.


The state doesn't regulate marriage because it's good for people. It does so because it is good for itself. The modern State is more powerful and overbearing than any institution that has ever existed in human history. It has no business regulating human relationships.

Only recently, with the advent of supra-religious states brought about by the French Revolution has it been made into a secular issue.
Let's get something straight here. First of all, people have been doing monogamous relationships for far longer than any religion has existed. Yes, we have done polygamous relationships as well, but there is no reason to think that religion has a monopoly on unity between two people. Second, the ""duty"" you talk about was performed most commonly not for love, but for duty, treaties, merging of properties, etc. If you think that marriage has recently been ""corrupted"", then certainly that would apply to the idea that it is about *love* at all, when this certainly wasn't the case in most early societies.",BrellK,t1_ck68kw6_1,1409584077.0,1.0,t3_2f3w7f,7
42316,616_A,"Now to the most important point...
Nobody is *forcing* you to get married, or even register your marriage with the state. People make the argument you are making, and I genuinely have to wonder if they understand how marriage works in our society.
You are not prohibited from living and loving any person of the opposite gender. The government is not going to arrest Tony because he loves Andrea, or because they live together.",BrellK,t1_ck68kw6_2,1409584077.0,1.0,t3_2f3w7f,7
42316,616_A,"If you don't want to give the State ""power"", then you don't have to apply for Marriage status, and you can just tell everyone you are married without having it be recognized by the state.
The State *does* have a vested interest in Marriage though, and that is why it provides a legal shortcut for couples who want to register. Again, couples **DO NOT HAVE TO REGISTER IF THEY SO CHOOSE.**",BrellK,t1_ck68kw6_3,1409584077.0,1.0,t3_2f3w7f,7
42316,616_A,"There are tons of these ""legal shortcuts"" that Marriage provides, which is one of the reasons why Homosexual Marriage is gaining more steam. There are *tangible* benefits that can be gained by registering your marriage with the State.
Don't think of it as the state saying ""We are officially sanctioning your relationship."" Instead, think of it as the state saying the following...",BrellK,t1_ck68kw6_4,1409584077.0,1.0,t3_2f3w7f,7
42316,616_A,"""We understand that you two people are in a relationship that combines many legal aspects of your persons together. Therefore, if you wish to register with us, we can make it much easier for you to combine your persons legally, instead of both of you having to do each part individually.""",BrellK,t1_ck68kw6_5,1409584077.0,1.0,t3_2f3w7f,7
42316,616_A,"As I said before, the State regulating Marriage is more about convenience of legality and it is certainly not about them deciding who is allowed to love whom.",BrellK,t1_ck68kw6_6,1409584077.0,1.0,t3_2f3w7f,7
48117,705_B,"As horrible as it sounds, given the fact that Gazans elected Hamas, which was a group that actively called for the destruction of the state of Israel and actively pursues this, they are literally saying they want a war with Israel... Or at least the majority of them are all for it. It seems wrong, and I myself acknowledge that, but after reading on the conflict a bit, this came to light and now I don't see these civilians as ""innocent"" as they are made out to be. I understand from a legal standpoint that punishing the civilians for wanting a war is probably not correct but when it comes to taking responsibility for their actions... don't they deserve this?


Note: This view is horrible and I really want to change it. I am pro-Israel, hate Hamas but am sad that these civilians are hurt in this conflict. This was the case until now but that view on civilians was shaken after this whole election thing.

Members of the Islamic Resistance Movement should consider the interests of the masses as their own personal interests. They must spare no effort in achieving and preserving them.

Even though it was poorly written my hope was that I could find out what is actually superior about Apple and what is just marketing.

I did learn a good amount about why professionals prefer Apple which I guess did change my mind because I didn't take that into consideration when I originally posted and it negates my claim that Apple is all marketing.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


*First off I want to say that I am not a fan boy. It's hard to get people to talk about this stuff because people so closely associate their personalities with branding nowadays but I am interested in learning about why people like Apple products are anything more that easy to use machines with good warranties.

I often observe nerds using and touting Apple products but to me the products don't offer any advantage that can't be countered by moderate understanding of computers. I feel that people pay a premium for apple products because the experience is streamlined and more safe from virus' malware etc.

For me, Apple offers a dumbed down experience that panders to the technologically illiterate and charges them a premium price because they don't know any better. I understand the arguments that the operating systems run more efficiently and that apple is supposed to have better customer service and warranties but do they? Isn't Apple more just forcing you to buy an extended warranty with your product. 

The old people comment comes from being in the teaching profession and observing that for the same price, teenagers today prefer similarly priced Android phones to Iphones. Does this mean that Apple is holding onto their market share because of old ideas of their supremacy in the smart phone market maintained by older people? I don't know maybe.

I'll give you some of my background with computers and phones. I grew up using Apple products. My parents always had apple's (or macintoshes) when I was a kid. We had a windows and an IMAC, I felt that for the price the Apple products were not worth it especially considering the limited upgradablity, which is only used by Apple to make more money. I have always bought windows computers since. I play games on my computer still but rarely ever a game that is very demanding in terms of graphics and processing. 

I have used both Android phones and Iphones and in my experience the two offer a similar quality. I prefer that android is far more customization that the Iphone so I use that but my current phone HTC-One M8 cost the same price as an Iphone. Although, I would argue that Apple's refusal to allow a microSD slot makes it a little overpriced still.

-The legal/logical aspect of the evidence and crime 

(Did they do it or not?)

-The social and mental wellbeing of the accused 

(Did other social/cultural factors indirectly contribute to the crime)

-The personal attitude of the accused towards their crime 

(Are they coldly oblivious/nonchalant or are they a decent human being who made a mistake?)



Our current bloated legal system has too many loopholes, redundancies, and obstacles that it is near impossible to see the humanity behind most of the accused. Instead of providing a judge with a list of every bad thing a person has done and encouraging someone else to speak for them, we use this system to encourage seeing the true person behind the crime and sentence accordingly.

EDIT: I realize ""provided all the evidence required"" is extremely unstable and ambiguous. I'll admit I hadn't thought that part through that much. I suppose I attributed it to some hand waving that along with this new legal system there would also be new evidence collection methods that were fair and impartial. I am not implying that it is up to the defendant to provide his own evidence. Perhaps a neutral evidence gathering body would be necessary.

EDIT2: Although I have been proven mostly wrong and have changed my view, I would still like to pursue this idea with discussion, so can we agree that if this system were implemented, no other already established legal loopholes and current legal system would also not exist? i.e. refuting my point by saying, ""you're stupid, without a lawyer, the defendant can't object!""

Fight the same enemy 100 times and you can. Can't beat these enemies? Go a few screens back and fight the enemies there 100 times until you're strong enough to proceed. Most RPGs can get away with this by having some major strategy in the battle system, or wonderful storytelling. The closest thing Pokemon has to this is its type weaknesses, most of which are obvious (Fire is weak to water). Even the ones that aren't obvious can only be discovered by trial and error and still don't add a huge amount of strategy to the game.

Imagine a new player about to reach Giovanni for the first time in the last gym. ""Oh, the next boss uses ground Pokemon? Let me just throw everything at it until I see what they're weak to. Water and grass? Let me fight the same Pokemon 100 times until I'm strong enough to fight them and win."" The best case scenario without grinding is to hope the RNG is on your side, which still seems like incredibly boring gameplay.

EDIT: I realize that part of this post was a bit unclear. I didn't mean the type weaknesses were confusing, I meant that they were at worst so obvious to not even count as strategy (water beats fire) and in other cases so obscure that weakness charts or trial and error were the only other way to solve them.

Granted, mikalaranda already changed my view (so soon), so unless you have something new to add I suggest you look at his response. It was perfect, I think.

52847,792_A,"Grinding and strategy aside, Pokemon was an insanely addicting and fun game. It's appeal wasn't just that it was a great game, but that it was a blockbuster experience.
1. Popularity. Almost every kid in school played it. You could trade with them, and battle against them, and best of all, you could talk shop with them. It was an easy way to make friends.",McKoijion,t1_cjff0g8_1,1407041204.0,1.0,t3_2ch2je,7
52847,792_A,"2. Pacing. The game was set up such that you were always just good enough to beat the next boss by the time you faced them. This meant that you didn't have to outright grind to beat bosses, but that you weren't too good either. This kept the focus on strategy instead of grinding. It was a simple strategy, but hey, I was in elementary school.",McKoijion,t1_cjff0g8_2,1407041204.0,1.0,t3_2ch2je,7
52847,792_A,"3. The game had the achievable, but still difficult goal of collecting every single Pokemon. Combined with the main story, this game could take people 50-100 hours of straight gameplay to beat. The battles weren't even the main part of the game. It was more about beating puzzles and collecting Pokemon, which made grinding and boss battles less important. By the end, I would often use ""repel"" just to avoid fighting random Pokemon (aka grinding) so that I could continue the puzzles and hunt for new Pokemon.",McKoijion,t1_cjff0g8_3,1407041204.0,1.0,t3_2ch2je,7
52847,792_A,"4. The game featured extremely addicting elements. This included the fun of raising adorable virtual pets (the game came out shortly after the Tamagotchi phenomenon.) It also included the element of chance. Finding Pokemon was often random, but was totally doable if you invested enough time. Every single Pokemon fight offered a chance to catch something new (at least until you found out what the Pokemon was.) It activated the same neural pathways as gambling in a casino. Hell, the game even featured a virtual token casino. If you add in a compelling story, and the drive to ""catch 'em all, you basically end up with crack for ten year olds.",McKoijion,t1_cjff0g8_4,1407041204.0,1.0,t3_2ch2je,7
52847,792_A,"3. It was a cultural phenomenon. The story was great, and it was supported by TV shows, movies, and a ton of additional media such as playing cards. There were tons of magazine covers and articles devoted to the Pokemon fad. The game was a big deal, and it felt like it.",McKoijion,t1_cjff0g8_5,1407041204.0,1.0,t3_2ch2je,7
52847,792_A,"Personally, I don't really see the appeal of playing Pokemon anymore, but I am way to old to be a part of their target audience. I still have a ton of nostalgia for Red and Blue though. That being said, while the initial hype has died down, the game has somehow stuck around. People still play them and have fun. Overall, Red and Blue were two of the best games I've ever played, and I think that even if people found the grinding and battle strategy a bit annoying sometimes, the rest of the game more than made up for it.",McKoijion,t1_cjff0g8_6,1407041204.0,1.0,t3_2ch2je,7
55812,821_A,"Lately, I've been reading up on the work of a man named [Guy McPherson](http://guymcpherson.com/), who is of the opinion that global warming will drive humanity to extinction within a few decades. The global temperature is increasing wildly, and in a few years many heavily populated areas will exceed ""wet bulb"" temperature, meaning they will become so hot that it would be impossible for human life to exist there. These areas would include much of the eastern and south-eastern United States. This would lead to the collapse of much of civilization, and untold numbers of deaths would surely follow. I admittedly don't know much about climate science, and I'm hoping if I did I would be able to dismiss this, but from what I've read, it seems fairly solid.

Even the US Navy has predicted an ice-free arctic by 2016, which seems to support the idea that global warming is increasing at an exponential rate.

I would really, really like my view on this changed.

Some of these could be accomplished for ~1billion dollars (more likely ~50 billion) But I mean seriously one billionaire could solve the problem if they wanted.

60514,890_B,"I have no particular preference for British English or American English. The English language is constantly changing and it should. 

But I do think that the distinction between the two, and the fact that some countries swear by British spelling and make you change your automatic spell checker and write all your papers/essays/advertisements/whatever in this spelling, is pointless. 

There is not enough of a difference between the two and we should rather let them naturally merge into one. 

I admit I'm not sure how this would happen. But I think for starters if students want to use American spelling in 'British-English-spelling' countries, Britain included, they should, and vice-versa. Similarly with any job that involves writing. 

I also don't see any issue with mixing them. They don't cause confusion because they are minor spelling differences... like using an s instead of a z in realise/realize...

Some companies even get edgy about this, as do universities. Which is problematic because what if you are quoting or paraphrasing an American author as a British-English student? And what if you are advertising in Britain for an American company? Seems problematic to uphold this. 

That's my view, go on, change it. 

EDIT: Public publishing is the main problem. People want consistency in a language that is naturally inconsistent. And it is naturally inconsistent because we uphold this distinction in things like schools, universities, and publishing of most kinds. There doesn't seem to be a good reason for keeping British kids from using American spelling in amongst their British spelling. It will naturally fix this silly language problem.

60544,890_B,"Yes it's pointless and problematic. Americans should start using real English like the rest of us.
And therein lies the problem. Because Americans won't want to start spelling things correctly, and Brits like me won't want to start spelling things wrong if the change goes the other way. We're attached to the spellings we grew up learning. Any attempt at homogenisation therefore will alienate someone and cause problems for those expected to change.",chilari,t1_cizwcvu_1,1405604219.0,8.0,t3_2ay3kf,22
60544,890_B,"There is also the issue of cost. It costs money to redo signage and change forms. A single sweeping action to change things overnight would involve massive administrative cost for governments, companies, schools and more.
Even a gradual change would be expensive. I'll use my job as an example. I'm a proposals co-ordinator, a job that invovles co-ordianting responses to clients' questions about how we'd build their project and why we're the best company to do it. This role includes reusing old text from previous submissions where questions are generic (health and safety questions, for example) and ensuring that the bid is well presented and professional, including formatting and proofreading. Generally, my proofreading of duplicated responses is quick fixes of previously missed errors when I'm formatting in the new document's style, and takes hardly any time at all. If I suddenly had to make sure all the spellings were American, I'd have to proofread properly - an extra 5-10 minutes per page of text. In documents that are frequently over 200 pages long, that could mean an extra two to four days' work per bid for the first few bids - and when the bid turnaround is three to six weeks, that's going to be difficult to find. I'd have to get an external person in to help out, putting up bid costs. And that's just bids. What about case studies? I keep the project case study library up to date. I'd need to go through that and take the ""e"" out of ""storeys"" for the height of every building we've built, and everything else that's different.

60545,890_B,"No seriously though, I get what you're saying exactly, but doesn't it confirm my point? I want this thing we speak to be called English and allow the differences in British and American spelling to fall away naturally. I'm suggesting that we never waste time making sure all the spellings of anything are one or the other. They are so close, we should just do away with the labels 'American' and 'British'.",da1s1,t1_cizwqdw_2,1405605472.0,1.0,t1_cizwcvu,22
60545,890_B,"I agree that your job would be much more expensive if you had to have *one kind of English spelling*, but I'm suggesting you let the spellings be different and they'll organically merge into one over time.
It sounds like your company already does that, and for the situation you're discussing it seems fine. But I find, for example, when advertisers want to post something, they want consistency in their print, and they'll use a particular spelling so it can be constant. Then they realise that they are advertising for a company with a name that contains a 'misspelled' word (see tyre, tire example) and this causes problems. Similarly with a university paper. Professors don't like inconsistency in spelling, but that is just perpetuating the problem of this distinction. If we all just stopped caring whose spelling was British or American, we would be able to get faster towards a unified English, which is a much more realistic thing in my opinion.",da1s1,t1_cizwqdw_3,1405605472.0,1.0,t1_cizwcvu,22
60548,890_B,"As far as your professors grading papers example goes, bear in mind that they're grading a lot of papers. If consistency within the paper is the goal, and which version used doesn't matter, this is going to make marking harder for professors, because they then have to stop to think at every word that's different in thw two versions ""which version of English is this student using again?"" Better that all papers submitted have the same version, make the professor's life easier, and tell students to stick to British English if they're at a British university, etc.",chilari,t1_cizx24w_1,1405606472.0,1.0,t1_cizwqdw,22
60548,890_B,"I'm not arguing that everyone *shouldn't* all be using the same English (and in my view it should be English English from England) but that the process needed to make this possible, whether enforced on a short time scale or whether permitted to ease over a longer timescale, isn't going to work as a deliberate effort. And yes, it is a deliberate effort if you mandate that professors can't mark students down for using the other spelling version, or mandate that clients can't discriminate against tenderers based on which spellings they use.",chilari,t1_cizx24w_2,1405606472.0,1.0,t1_cizwqdw,22
60548,890_B,"And still you're going to get stallwarts who will point out that spelling ""storey"" (to mean levels in a building) differently from ""story"" (to mean a tale or narrative sequence of events) facilitates clearer understanding, which is after all the reason we have spellings designated as ""correct"" in the first place and don't allow people to spell words any way they like. And you're going to get people who say ""I've always spelled it analyze, I'm not changing now because someone says so."" And you're definitely going to get people (me, for example) who point out that Americans can call their language what they like but if everyone has to spell things the same, English is being spelled the English way. It's not implementable as a deliberate effort. You can let things change as a natural process over the next hundred or more years, but you can't go around saying ""everyone spell it this way, you've got five years to transition to this"" and expect anyone is going to accept it.",chilari,t1_cizx24w_3,1405606472.0,1.0,t1_cizwqdw,22
60548,890_B,"Language is part of identity, and people don't react well when told to change part of what makes up their identity. Languages have been forcibly suppressed in the past, with punishments for people speaking Irish or Catalan in public in Ireland and Catalonia respectively. That never ended well, because the way people speak - and the way we write - is part of who we are. Being told ""you have to change so everyone is the same and stuff is easier for a few people"" isn't fair. It's a denial of what makes us different, and what makes us different is important.

Ok I think this should not be too difficult for professors. I think they should, as I certainly do, glance over it.

Shakespeare could spell words however he liked... and, as such, invented hundreds of words which we use today, and consider 'standard'. And words are constantly changing in spelling. The internet, and short message sending, has, for instance, had an impact on how dictionaries spell some words. Also, eg. Derrida, introduces the word 'differance' into the English dictionary.

60549,890_B,Your strongest point here with respect to changing my view is the identity part. It *may* be unfair on British identity to say that they *must* bow to the pressure of American globalisation by accepting American spelling as the new English spelling.

The changes aren't that minor. It's not just spelling, but also word use that would be expected to change. Trousers to ""pants"", when we already use ""pants"" to mean something else, for example. The boot of a car becomes a ""trunk"", babies' nappies become daipers, rubbish becomes trash. We're told to think differently, to spell differently, to use words differently. And it stops being our language and becomes someone else's language, imposed though unwanted. It's stops being the language we grew up with, the language of our grandparents and parents, and severs links with the past.

You can't even make people stop teaching their children how to use it the way they want to. You can't just wipe out a language for convenience - again I'll bring up Catalan, because Franco tried to wipe that out in favour of using Spanish universally across the Catalan region, for the convenience of his government and apparent unity in Spain. It didn't work. People are attached to their language - whether it diverges in a big way like Catalan, or a small way like British English does from American English. The harder you try to wipe it out, the harder people will try to hold onto it. Even if you try an apparently passive approach like you're advocating, people will still see it as an invasion of their identity, an attempt to make everyone the same, when there's nothing wrong with people being different - and in fact a lot right with tolerating diversity and accepting differences, because it promotes tolerance and understanding of different perspectives in other things too.",chilari,t1_cizyl7b_4,1405610483.0,3.0,t1_cizy3py,22

It seemed to me, from this perspective, that our attachment to British English is unnecessary and we should allow students to learn the language as easily as possible.

I would consider myself more independent compared to other teenage girls, however I believe that research is required before making decisions such as birth control.

I believe that teenage girls are first of all not mature enough to have a well researched, or experience say in their sex lives. Their parents have gone through decisions like these, and if teenage girls do not have the ability to trust their parents, then they do not have the ability to trust their own decisions. Especially since birth control involves potential health risks that teenage girls may not be aware of increasingly validates the point that teenage girls should talk to their parents before deciding whether or not they should take birth control pills.

Another point is that I believe if teens were given the ability to take birth control without the consent of their parents, they would be increasingly prone to chances of obtaining sexually transmitted diseases. To prevent this, teenagers should talk to their parents about possible health risks involved with taking birth control pills.

However, being a teenage girl myself I feel that my opinions are not well researched and do not consider the statuses of other teenage girls within their families. I would really appreciate it if you guys could contribute your opinion and expand my knowledge on the issue.

63925,934_B,"As western societies have modernized and industrialized, they have slowly begun shedding old-fashioned social taboos that never really made much sense in the first place. For example, sexism, or the notion that women have no place in the public sectors of business and government, and racism or the idea that different people are automatically born to menial positions in society because of the color of their skin. Just in very recent years, people have finally begun getting past homophobia, or the notion that gay, lesbian and transgender people should be denied rights and considerations which heterosexual people take for granted.  

But one area where old-fashioned social taboos are still relatively untouched is the area of dress codes. We judge one another based on how we dress, and we do so for the stupidest reasons. As the wiki explains:  

&gt;In practical use, dress codes are either followed intuitively or enforced by peer pressure, so that people wear similar clothing in the same situations.  

That doesn't tell you the half of it. Judgments about clothing are inflexible and automatic, with no appeal. For instance, if I were to go into work next week and announce that I have decided that I am a woman (I am a man), my colleagues would be supportive, enthusiastic and curious. However if I came to work wearing a [dashiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiki) and a [kufi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashiki), they would assume I had lost my mind. If I came to work wearing a cape, underwear and cowboy boots I might face termination. 

The consequences of stepping outside accepted dress codes can be severe, and nobody thinks twice about the prejudices and odd assumptions that underlie our attitudes about clothing. In certain fields, for example business and law, failure of men to wear the standard western business suit or women to wear the Condoleeza-style western pantsuit can have dire if unofficial consequences. However talented or hardworking or good at your job you might be, you can quickly find yourself essentially ostracized, disrespected by your employers, clients and colleagues, mocked, and driven out of the profession. Almost exactly like a termite with foreign pheromones, your colleagues will turn on you and eat you alive. 

For fun, here's the famous scene in [*American Psycho*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cISYzA36-ZY) that brilliantly satirizes our obsession with dress and dress codes.  

**TL;DR - for all of western culture's progress in terms of getting rid of old prejudices, [western dress codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dress_code_\(Western\)) are almost absurdly driven by social prejudice and fear of what is strange, unusual or different. There's no actual benefit to having such inflexible dress codes, and therefore this needs to change. CMV.**

For example, and I'm just making these figures up, let's say I'm applying to be a chemical engineer at a manufacturing facility in Cincinnati. Based on the extensive research I've done, I know that chemical engineers with my credentials should make between $90K-110K a year.

I make it through 3 rounds of interviews, and the company offers me the job, and says they'll pay me 75K a year. Based on my research, I know that number is unfair, so I negotiate until I reach somewhere between 90K-110K. If the company doesn't agree to pay me what I believe to be the industry standard (and what a man would make in that position), I walk. Or I accept the lower pay, knowing that it is my fault I'm making less than what I'm worth.

Women who complain that they aren't making equal pay to men either didn't do their proper research when applying for the job, didn't negotiate their salaries effectively, or are too lazy to leave and find another job which pays them what they're worth.

Some individuals don't do much work at all, but when middle management comes to supervise, these people act absurdly happy to see them and are eager to agree with all of the managers' ideas. To me, this seems hypocritical and unethical.

Meanwhile, I have been working at this job for a year now (I'm the 5th most senior employee out of 35 - there's a lot of turnover) and have put my heart into developing the craft, doing it faster and more efficiently every day, and delivering the best possible product to our guests. But if a manager comes around, I pretty much treat them the same way as I would any other human being. I care about them, but I'm never going to kiss someone's ass or agree to do something that seems backwards, or just ethically wrong, without at least asking why. My managers overlook how much I help the company and how loyal I am to them, and basically treat me like a delinquent because, to them, I ""talk back"" too much. I feel like I deserve a lot more respect than that, considering that I'm the very lowest paid employee, and at the same time one of the most effective.

In a pinch, maybe a 9mm can stun a bear for a few seconds, but if you're carrying a pistol, your intended target is definitely not an animal. It's a human.

And I don't buy the argument that they can be used for target shooting. Target shooting is practice for killing people. Why do you think that the human silhouette target is the ""default"" handgun target?

In any case, I believe that the only reason anyone would own a handgun is because they intend to some day kill another human, either in cold blood or in self defense.

85187,1219_B,"I am liberal in the modern political sense of the word.  I don’t want to get into semantics so I’m not claiming to be a follower of classical liberalism or neo-liberalism or anything else but a modern and hyper liberal American.  Since I love this subreddit I’ll provide you with some easy arguments for you to knock down.  =)  I will change my view if you can show how ‘forward thinking, inclusivism, secularism, or personal liberty’ are bad values to have or show in some way that being a modern liberal is bad for myself or society. 

WHAT IS LIBERALISM? 

1) 	Forward Thinking –  I believe social liberalism correctly pushes the boundaries of what society currently thinks is acceptable towards more egalitarian bounds.  Conservative thinking is dominated by ideas like “tradition” and “maintaining order or status quo” which it advances at the cost of excluding certain groups.  I specifically believe that tradition is harmful as it inappropriately resists change without providing merit.  I believe the abolition of slavery, suffrage of women, lax immigration policies, and the guaranteeing of rights by the government are liberal ideas that are beneficial to society.

2) 	Inclusivism – I believe liberalism is an ideology that tries to include as many people as possible.  I feel liberalism correctly values the group over the individual.  (ex: What good are ‘my’ rights if I only get them by infringing on others?)  I believe that everyone is better off when everyone is given equal protection and rights.  When employees have enough disposable income to purchase consumer goods they increase economic output much more than if all the income and wealth was concentrated in the hands of few individuals. (see banana republics vs current America and debt fueled consumption as one of the primary cause of the 1930s and 2008 depressions).  

3) 	SECULARISM – I believe that governments and all non-religious groups should operate in a completely secular manner because it provides better real world results and doesn’t disenfranchise anyone.  I believe that corporations should not be able to espouse or enforce particular religious beliefs (ex: a church can be doctrinally against birth control but it, nor any business, should not be allowed to deny said birth control to its employees).  In matters of science vs faith I will always side with science as I believe ‘most’ liberals would.  I place zero merits in matters of faith when presented as such and believe morality is not provided by, grounded in, nor should it be regulated by, a religion.  (Any claim not based in fact is either a working hypothesis or a statement of faith.  I may have to accept partial blame for ‘radical hippies’ that do not support data driven science such as gmo haters and nuclear power scardy-cats.  It seems that these people are in the minority among liberals BUT If you feel the ‘average liberal’ supports these types of faith based anti-data claims then please hammer away at me).  


4) 	PERSONAL LIBERTY – The government is the primary protector of the citizen’s rights and liberties.  Personal responsibility outlined by libertarians and conservatives only goes so far since vigilante enforcement is not as conducive to society as official police actions and lynch mobs should be replaced by a judiciary.  Liberals believe that morality and personal behavior should not be regulated by an outside entity.  Free love, marrying whomever you chose, freedom of and from religion, 1st and 4th amendment rights, and the right to privacy, are all liberal ideas that I support.  I do not believe you have the right to infringe on the rights of others.  I believe that women are the equals of men and that all races are equal to each other.  “Separate but equal” is not equal and true equality not only means equal rights but equal opportunity to fulfill those rights.

Lightning round...

5) 2nd Amendment = pro gun ownership, pro heavy regulation

6) Big Government = globalization and big businesses need big  government support.  Remember only conservatives say ""I demand big government get their hands off my medicare"".

7) Taxes = The required big government needs big income.  Our current government is too big and can be for sure be streamlined, but it cannot be halved or quartered.  

8) Climate Change = I side with science.  No, there is no debate.

9) Abortion = I can prove with science that the mother is alive.  Until you can prove with science that a specific subset of her cells commonly known as a fetus is a separate and living organism capable of equal amounts of autonomy as the mother then I feel you have no ground to stand on.  

10) The Draft = Against it.  Unless America is facing a crisis of civilization ending proportions then there's no need to dilute a strong fighting force with people that don't want to be there.

88110,1253_A,"Everything I read on it suggests that we have serious fundamental hurdles to overcome. From what I understand, it's impossible to measure a quantum system without affecting it, which ruins any computations it's making. I don't see how we can get passed that.

They also have to be at extremely low temperatures to work. Now, I'm sure that someday we can figure out a few of these problems, but in the end, I predict that we will never get any useful computations out of them.

Quantum computing seems like a fundamentally flawed concept and is way too good to be true.

89074,1265_B,"I am a Pro-Choice person. I believe that there exists a certain privacy in the doctors office that a judge or a police officer cannot go to ban any procedure that happens there...

However, I think that banning abortion will be a pointless exercise whose only affect will be to harm the women who still get abortions. Currently we should be thankful that we live in a age that women can get safe and effective abortions with minimal damage. 

I think that if tomorrow an abortion ban were affected, that by the end of the day there will be just as many abortion clinics, but they will all move undergound. And these underground abortions *will* harm women, because they are operating below the law and there would be people who aren't even trained in the medical field preforming these procedures. 

I think an abortion ban would do nothing to address the demand for abortions. If we look at this from a market POV... there is a demand for 1.2 million abortion in the USA each year. Limiting the supply, will only drive up the price of the service... it does nothing to lower the fundamental demand for the service. 

Since when does banning a product or service lower the demand for it? Or even lower the ease to receive it? It is currently 9:30 pm on a thursday night... I know where I can get a prostitute in an hour. I know where I can get Marijuana in an hour. I don't know where to get cocaine or heroine, right now... but I bet if asked, I can get some by midnight. 

We had a constitutional amendment to ban alcohol... that did nothing to stop people from getting alcohol.

I don't think that banning abortion will stop abortions. CMV

89521,1275_B,"I have no problem with people who are gay, lesbian, bi, trans or whatever.  I strongly believe in life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness and if you're not hurting anyone, then you get your freak on and be whoever you are.  

However, the labels are getting to be a bit too much.  I agree with a sentiment that I see all over the CMV sub:  a lot of these labels are created by attention seekers who can't stand to be part of an already defined group and must create their own category.  No amount of evidence, arguing, diversity seminars or PowerPoint slide presentations will convince me that there's a difference between bisexual and Pansexual.  However, I have no dog in this fight.  I am a straight male who happy being a male and doing manly things.  

First, it was LGBT.  Then it was LGBTQ.  Now it's LGBTQIA.  Again, not my concern.  They can use as many letters and/or labels as they want.  However, I find the use of the term ""cisgendered"" or ""cissexual"" to be ridiculous.  It is an unnecessary term.

[According to The Williams Institute](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/williams-institute-report-reveals-million-gay-bisexual-transgender/story?id=13320565), approximately 4% of the population classifies themselves as LGBT.  That leaves 96% who do not.  I do not know the validity of this number and I'm sure there is a range of agreed upon statistics.  

In my opinion, cisgendered or cissexual is the ""default"" setting.  Those with alternate sexual or gender identities are the minority.  That in no way suggests or implies that they are bad or wrong.  There are simply less of them.  I think it's rather safe to assume that someone is cis unless they tell me otherwise.  If they want me to know that they fall into a different category (or even a variety of different categories) then I assume that they will tell me.  I do subscribe to the rather antiquated notion that what you prefer to do in the bedroom is your own business and doesn't need to be broadcasted, but that's just me.

[Polydactyly](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polydactyly) exists.  It affects a small portion of the population and thus, there is a label or designation for it.  In no way is this label meant to shame or degrade those with the condition.  However, one who is born with no extra fingers or toes does not require a label.  Why?  Because most people have 10 fingers and 10 toes.  It doesn't make them better.  There are just more of them.  Designating someone as ""non-polydactyl"" is ridiculous.

There is a small percentage of the population that is designated as ""special needs"".  This is a broad term that can apply to many different conditions.  Again, the label ""special needs"" in no way is meant to demean them or belittle them.  However, it would be unnecessary to introduce you to my ""regular needs"" friend, Eugene.  

Somewhere along the line, ""normal"" became a pseudo-slur.  If I advertise myself as ""just a normal guy"", then I have implied that someone different from me (perhaps, gay or trans) is ""abnormal"".  Now that word does carry a certain air of disgust, even though it's definition simply means ""unusual"" or ""uncommon"".  I would never refer to a person whose gender identity or sexual preference was different than mine as ""abnormal"", but I find it confusing that some folks get angry if it's implied that they are part of a smaller group.

""Minority"" carries a lesser degree of the same stigma.  ""Minority"" just means you're part of a smaller group.  By definition, left-handed people are a minority (roughly 11%).  However, if you informed 100 left handed people that they were in a minority, I find it difficult to believe that any one of them would be offended.

Patton Oswalt had a great bit about watching a group of kids playing some elaborate game with all sorts of rules and regulations.  

*So they would say: ""Okay, uh, the bike path over at the skaffetys' is lava and if you touch that, you're dead.  And then the hedges over at the slingerlands' are poison snakes...and if you go over there they'll bite you and you're dead.*

One of the kids proclaims Patton to be dead because he touched the bike path and the bike path is lava.  He then has to explain that he's not playing and the lava rule doesn't really apply to him.  That's exactly how I feel.  I'm not playing. 

I don't need someone else to give me a label because I don't fit into a smaller group.    

Feel free to change my view, but be aware that any replies lambasting my ""cis privilege"" will be completely ignored.



Edit:  ok.  I learned quite a bit today.  I tend to think in terms of black and white and lesser in shades of grey.  In short, the ""cis"" term isn't so much a label that was made up for the sake of yet another label, but as a needed term for when those with gender and sexual diversity have a discussion that warrants it.  

Part of my issue was/is that I never really interact with much diversity.  I have a few gay, lesbian and bi friends and while it's not a secret, that characteristic just doesn't come up in conversation.  The few people that I've met that do exhibit some gender diversity or otherwise ""unique"" sexual preferences were absolutely unbearable.  They waved it around like a big obnoxious flag, thoroughly daring anyone to try and ignore them.

Thanks everybody.  I do have some comments to delta and I will do that tonight.  I'm currently heading out to take care of some bi'ness.

I have seen people brush other people off as soon as they are no longer of use to them. I have seen people humiliate others to gain personal satisfaction out of their embarrassment. Like I said, this developed recently, because in my youth (I know, I know, I am not that old) I used to believe in a world where people were nice to each other for the sake of being nice, no agendas served, no advantages taken. I behaved according to my own moral code, which was basicly comprised of being nice to other people, no matter what. Apparently, the world is a harsh place, where people are always looking to rip others' throats out. Realizing this, I changed, I turned bitter and cynical. Please CMV.

Marriage is confining.  Evolutionarily speaking, most people are serial monogamists.  The fact that at least forty percent of American marriages are marked by adultery makes this apparent.

The majority of marriages are unhappy.  In the West, over half of  marriages end in separation or divorce. One cannot pretend that remaining marriages survive because their participants are so happy.  Often, marriages persist due to religious, financial, and emotional threats.  

Separations and divorces can be crippling.  When one partner is the ""breadwinner"" and the other is the homemaker, the homemaker is often left financially dependent.  Children can suffer immensely from relocation and emotional strife that develops within the family. 

I understand the financial perks of marriage and possible benefits of marriage when there are children.  I am not against anybody's *right* to marry.  However, as the son of two parents who had a nasty split, I am reminded of the pitfalls of marriage everyday.   

I don't want to feel this way, though.  I hope the evidence is there to change my view.  I would love a long-term partner, but think many girls would see a guy against marriage as one who cannot commit.

A kid also means that a low income family now has less money to focus on taking care of themselves. Ideally, this policy would be enacted like so:

Any low income stairwell will have a box of free condoms at the bottom with pamphlets explaining effective birth control methods, Information on abortion, and why it is a bad idea to have a kid if you can't afford it.

Any woman who makes less than $20,000 a year wanting an extra $1000 from the government can earn said money by coming into a clinic every 6 months and confirming via ultrasound that she is not pregnant.

If you are low income and you are pregnant, you lose that $1000 yearly bonus for five years.

Currently, a family can get additional welfare money if they have a kid. For my proposed system, this rule would be thrown away as it would defeat the purpose on the incentive for not having kids.

Being an eager reader, I have tried to read some books by Franz Kafka, but the thing is I have had a bad experience with him.

Some years ago (I must have been around 15 y/o), I read *The Trial*. It's been some time so my memories may be wrong but the overall thoughts I have over this book is that it was a sequence of confused, very absurd and unfair events.
I am not saying I reject the idea of absurd, I really enjoy plays by Beckett or Ionesco. But here I thought that I had missed something, a meaning, or maybe I was too young for this.

So, this summer, I dediced to give Kafka a second chance and I got myself a copy of The Metamorphosis. After a couple of chapters, I felt that I was not in the same mood as he was and I found the book (juding from the few chapters that I have read !) quite naive and not entertaining.

Therefore, my relationship with Kafka is disappointing. This partly saddens me for I know there must be something that I did not grasp.

The surrealism and absurdity is what defines his work. Most of his work deals with existentialism and the conflict and angst that arise in life. It's supposed to be jarring, alienating, and brutal in a wretching sort of way. Like Lovecraft, he delves into generic nature and how sins of the parents are visited upon children, without them having a hand in the situation, and their path of atonement. Hopelessness, persecution, and oppression in the face of the world and the dehumanizing effects of faceless bureaucracy are also wide theme he touches on.

120082,1726_A,"Hello, I'm new to this sub.
I am coming from [THIS THREAD](http://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/1wabmp/usda_shuts_down_kosher_calf_slaughterhouse_after/).

I don't understand why it is important to some that animals that are to be slaughtered should be treated humanely. If they are going to die anyways, why should we put in extra effort to ensure that the animals are comfortable? I find it extremely hypocritical to sugarcoat the process of killing. Is it not just plain reality that humans own the food chain, and we bred these animals for consumption?

In addition, I cannot imagine even in nature where humane treatment occurs for carnivorous animals. Do other animals ever care about HOW they are killing a rabbit or deer that they are about to eat? Why are we expected to treat food like they are another sentient being with feelings? (That sounds weird but I can't think of another way to say it.) Isn't it natural to not have feelings for something that we are going to slaughter? (e.g. Fido for pet dog that we will keep as a companion vs #5936 for the cow that I will get ribeye steak from).


I never really empathized with animal rights people when it came to animals that were being utilized for human consumption (including vaccine testing and to a certain extent, various product testing). Please help me understand.

EDIT: Thank you all for replying. I would like to refine my question a bit more...

I understand that we are morally able and that we are above other predators observed in nature in that ethical sense. I know that it sucks to be the animal being submitted to pain and killing. But as a low income meat lover, why should I care when the free range chicken is more expensive than tyson, or some other big name meat brand? As I stated in my reply to /u/confictedfelon, how does humane treatment policies affect cost and availability of meat? 


EDIT 2: /u/fnredditacct received a delta for convincing me on a personal scale that I can relate to. I always had gas problems, and I go through more than a dozen eggs a week. She mentioned that her family experienced less gas, and felt fuller with the eggs. I was able to confirm most of her points after trying the organic ones myself.


However, I think I am still somewhat unconvinced about some of the other things. This I realize is mostly based on the fact that I have very little understanding of what ethics is. I understand it on a basic level, such as don't hurt others, but when it came to weighing animals' rights to my own satisfactions, that became a bit skewed. I will attempt to learn a bit more on my own how this factors in. Please feel free to enlighten me a bit more in this area.


In addition, some are still under the impression that I WANT to TORTURE the animals before slaughter. Please let me clarify by saying that I do NOT want animals to be tortured. Torture implies an intent to hurt. I guess I am more faithful in the butchers that they are not sociopaths that want to torture animals, and that if an animal experiences a lot of pain in the kill process that they are a more rare occurrence. Again, I am most likely operating here under limited knowledge. Regardless, I fully understand that pain and suffering is unnecessary, and I hope that we can provide pain-free meat for people like me. But until we can somehow bridge the cost gap between free range and organic meats vs big brand meats, I will most likely be forced to remain in the cheaper meat section.

120083,1726_A,All of us are going to die just like those animals. Does that mean that our comfort doesn't matter? The destiny of all things is to die so their lives are all they have. We should offer them at least some measure of comfort or at least minimize their pain.  Why treat them badly simply for being born a cow or pig or chicken. We don't have to put the animal through hardship that could be avoided. Animals don't understand that the way they kill animals matters. But we are sophisticated enough to understand their pain and so we should avoid it whether or not animals in nature act that way. Just because something is destined to be slaughtered doesn't mean that it can't be happy. A chicken who loves it's life freely and with safety on a nice farm and is killed lived as good a life as a chicken can.

120869,1737_A,"Insurance companies are highly profitable, and that in and of itself should let you know that they aren't going to help the AVERAGE customer at all.  The VAST majority of people pay more into their Auto, Health, Home, and any other kind of insurance than they will ever get out of it.  Essentially insurance companies are like casinos: They figure out the expected value and charge you more for it.  Let's say that there is a 10% chance each year that a person will get a cold, and that it will cost $70 to fix.  The insurance company knows that on average, a person should have to pay $7.00 in order to balance everything out.  Instead, they charge the average customer $10.00.  Therefore everyone who has health insurance would be better off saving that $10.00 that they pay for insurance and using it when they need it, 1/10 years.  Same goes for auto, house, and every type of insurance.  I have 2 cancer survivors in my family, and even THEY have spent more money on insurance (roughly adjusted for inflation, so this shouldn't be taken as fact) than they ever would.

**I can understand liability coverage being required**.  If you haven't been smart enough to save up enough money then someone else shouldn't have to suffer when you cause damages.  But I don't know anyone who has had comprehensive auto insurance for more than 15 years and hasn't come out losing money than if they'd have saved.

Getting back to the economics of it, if the average customer broke even, no insurance company would stay in business for more than a year due to overhead.  So by getting rid of insurance, we would (as a whole society) each have more money AND we wouldn't have to deal with the bureaucracy and increased overhead that come from high-powered insurance companies.  

As for the gambling analogy, if you were to go to a cassino, and spend your health insurance check on a game that has 49% odds and deposited all your money into a bank account, you would come out over your life time with more money than if you took that same check to an insurance company.

127121,1825_B,"This kind of started off as an argument with my roommates and I, however I recently noticed on thread here on Reddit (the one on what people 100 years from now will find barbaric that we find acceptable now) that my opinion seems to be the unpopular one on the matter.

I live in Toronto, which for all intents and purposes is a fairly large, densely populated city (~3 million in the city proper), and so yes I deal with congestion, gridlock, and generally stupid drivers on a regular basis. Nevertheless I still love driving. Part of the reason is because of how inefficient our public transit system is one could still get around the city in the same amount of time as it would to drive, even in rush-hour traffic. Sure parking might be an expensive inconvenience from time to time, but I like many people drive not just as a mode of transportation, but because its actually an enjoyable activity for me.

I understand that self-driving cars *could* eliminate gridlock and save ""countless"" lives by removing the human error that comes with driving (I emphasize the could because from what I know there aren't any actual statistics or studies that I am aware of that can support this). That said, I think people forget that even extremely simple technology does fail from time to time. If anything were to go wrong in a self-driving car, how would someone be able to intervene? I mean if we were introduced to self-driving cars tomorrow, I wouldn't be as concerned because most people would know how to control the vehicle. But if years from now, when people have become accustomed to self-driving cars, would they know how to control the car if the self-driving mechanism fail, or would it be just a matter of placing complete faith in a computer technology created by the same humans who's error we're trying to avoid?

I personally think it would also take what enjoyment there is in driving away from the experience. As mentioned, if I wanted a mode of transportation where I didn't have to do anything (at all) I would just take public transit. I enjoy driving because I can control both my speed and my route (if I want to go out of my way to take a more scenic route home, I have the option), all in the comfort of a private vehicle with my own music playing and my own company. Although a self-driving car wouldn't affect the latter, the former (which is the reason why I drive rather than ask others for rides) would be compromised. 

There's an entire culture and community around driving that revolves around making improvements to what you drive and I can't help but feel that'd completely disappear with self-driving cars. I wouldn't be opposed to people buying self-driving cars if that's truly what they want (no different that people who chose to buy cars with automatic transmissions) or even if there were the option to turn on a self-driving mode (which I'll admit would be nice in bumper-to-bumper traffic where you're really not even driving anyways), but my view is exactly that to have the **option**. So Reddit, I apologize for my long-winded post but I look forward to you changing my view so that I might be more open to the idea of this technology that so many people are sure might become the new norm !

EDIT: I completely forgot to include the second part of my argument.

Through much of my youth, I have simply accepted what they've said because they're all I've been influenced by. Approaching adulthood, I've come to realize their ways of thinking aren't necessarily true and I have begun to form my own beliefs regarding the nature of existence, life, and things of that nature. I prefer that my beliefs have scientific support and are free of pseudoscience... I like thinking critically as of late, but that trait doesn't apply evenly to everywhere in my life, for better or for worse.

My entire life, I've been pounded with things such as ""global warming is a hoax,"" ""the north pole may be warming, but the south pole is cooling,"" ""cows do more damage than humans do,"" and ""we humans affect the earth like a thermostat affects a house; the outside's influence is much stronger than the thermostats."" ... Honestly, I have no idea as to the verity of any of those statements, but they're common quips I hear from what can only be described as they describe themselves: Christian Republican capitalists (and Islamaphobes, but they tend not to like that term).

Sometimes I think controversial opinions are true, or at least hold water, when it comes to things like diet or health: for instance, I'm a huge proponent of the ""Paleo"" diet in comparison to government-recommended ones. There are a great many reasons why I support such a diet, and if great reasons - namely scientifically-backed ones - are able to convince me that climate change is a serious issue, as well as anthropogenic (but especially the latter), my view will certainly be changed.

I have a feeling that my opinion could be wrong, that it could be right, or that it could be way off and extremely oversimplified. This could go a million different directions.

145191,2061_B,"As I see it, children come out of school having learned a large number of facts (or not as the case may be) but have very little understanding about the 'why' and 'wherefore' of the world they're in.

I am not saying that the facts should not be taught.  Far from it - they are important and help these people become useful members of society.  However thinking about thinking; contemplating the idea of motivation for action; and similar things are generally completely lacking from modern western education systems.

From what I've seen, this leads to a society with a very large number of shallow, self-absorbed people.  Many people haven't emotionally developed beyond a very rudimentary idea of gratification and getting what they want.

If you look to our history, this has always generally been the case.  Historically, we had much more noticeable class systems with the 'elite' and the 'proletariat'.  The elite did study philosophy whereas the proles generally did not.  While I'm not saying this was a good situation, it did 'work' for society as a whole.

In the modern world however, the classes are being broken down.  They're not gone, but they're definitely different and weaker than they were before.  One very important difference now is that the people who might once have been 'proles' can effect real change in society through equal voting rights.  This is a good thing (in my opinion); but as a consequence, it is now more vital to have the widest range of people understanding some of the less tangible aspects of thought - e.g. philosophy - so that their vote isn't controlled by those who have learned how to control them.

If people learned philosophy at school, there would be more people able (and willing) to contribute meaningfully to society as a whole, leading to a better life for everyone.

A high school degree is so incredibly vital that a learning disorder should never prevent someone from obtaining it. I can even understand helping them out in undergraduate university. However when it comes to graduate school I believe the school has a responsibility to produce good graduates, not pander to those that can’t handle it no matter the reason. I know we have people from different parts of the world so by graduate school, I mean a professional level school like medical school, veterinary school, law school, anything after you get your first university degree. 

I’m in veterinary school right now. There are students that have to take exams by themselves and they also get twice as long. That just doesn’t make sense to me. If you can’t take an exam with everyone else, you sure as hell won’t survive in a stressful situation in which you have to make life and death decisions with tons of people around you. I just don’t believe that we should be making exceptions for learning disorders when a huge part of graduate school is proving you can handle the stress. 

So reddit, change my view. Why should graduate schools bother helping those with learning disorders?

* i'm not calling anyone stupid. Many of you have mistaken my post as claiming those with learning disabilities are for some reason intellectually inferior. This was not my intent. My post is purely about performance. 

* I certainly did lump a lot of disorders together and this makes the debate quite difficult. I also failed to mention that I will really be looking at this from a medical profession point of view. Yes, I'm sure there are professions out there where many of these disorders wouldn't be a hinderance towards performance, my apologies there. 

* I also put far too much weight on the ""stress"" aspect. That's just one particular example. Many disorders have various problems and stress isn't always one of them. 

Edit 2: I wanted to share the one delta i've given out so far. The general point was that on true time/demonstration based exams that occur later in clinical type years of schooling, they are not allowed to accommodate if it will fundamentally change the exam.

Edit 4: Second delta given. The post was a story of a man's wife and how she became a computer programer, was good at it but took a lot longer than everyone else because of her disability. She stayed in jobs long enough to get promoted and then was fired pretty quickly for not meeting deadlines and such.

For this field she also would need accommodation in school, but it would work out. Much better in the end. He ended his post with this
&gt;I think there are many accommodations that are useful, but there are instances were no amount of accommodation will help. Having professionals realistically discuss options based on skill set is best for everyone involved.

My tl;dr response to this was that in the end, the laws are far too broad. However more good is likely to come of them than bad. Those that fail in the profession do just that, they fail. But more are likely to succeed if they chose a proper profession than than fail. It would likely be far too difficult to change the laws in a way to diminish the failures, they're going to happen. I should really be focussing on the successes. Just because they will likely fail in my profession doesn't mean the laws are overall a bad thing.

155972,2203_A,"Hey all!

I'm talking about the really big unions, with hundreds or thousands of local groups and up to hundreds of thousands of members. I'm emphatically not talking about small, independent unions formed to fight for workers.

The impression I've gotten from media coverage is that large unions have a few principal problems that combine to make rather unhelpful organizations:

* Large unions tend, from what I've seen, to have a leadership clique that has its own views that aren't necessarily the views of the majority of workers, often by way of things like the current set of executive nominating the new executive, and having them ratified by a large percentage of workers who will vote the union ticket without much thinking. The result is that over time, the union leadership tends to just be the people who will keep the union going in the same direction. It doesn't help that radicalism sounds sexy, and so the elected leaders tend to be very strongly pro-union. This tendency towards a certain kind of person in charge tends, I think, to encourage the other issues I have with them.
* Large unions seem to love to treat labour unions like an end and not a means. They often give the impression of forgetting that the fundamental purpose of a union is collective bargaining, and instead become large lobby organizations that use their member dues to fight in the political arena. An excellent example is when a union representing some, but not all, workers at a given employer manages to get a deal requiring all employees to be unionized. While this might sound good on the face of it, if the employer (say, a construction worker) also wishes to hire employees in a job that isn't normally unionized (say, HR), this puts a tremendous drag on the employer and ultimately isn't likely to benefit the represented employees.
* Large unions seem to invariably end up in the political arena on things not directly related to their fundamental work. It is entirely understandable for a union of any size to be in the political arena arguing for and against measures that directly relate to its fundamental work of collective bargaining, such as by arguing against a back-to-work bill, or lobbying for anti-scab legislation, the bigger unions seem to often go beyond that by arguing for things that affect ""the working-class"", such as arguing for lower taxes. On the face of it, this seems like their job, because they represent workers, but in reality, I think that unions should stay out of these debates because it is not their job to dictate the political preferences of their members. They may have members who want to pay more tax and get more public services, and they may have members who want the government to stay out of their lives. They are members of the union for an imminently practical reason and should not be forced into conflict on political grounds. (Even worse, some unions seem to go even farther into the political arena, coming up with positions on things like Israeli-Palestinian relations, which have nothing to do with their members' jobs or well-being)
* Lastly, and probably most importantly, the big unions seem to often be extremely insensitive to the employers' needs, ultimately to the detriment of the workers they represent. The unions get into a narrow state of mind where increased wages and benefits are always seen as good things, regardless of the cost. The most egregious example of this is Hostess Foods, which recently closed its doors because the union refused to come to terms. Ultimately, the union's decision to hold out did not help any of its members; instead, they all lost their jobs because the demands were too steep. For a longer-term example, the auto industry in the USA was done in by increasing union-derived benefits which they had to pay for, draining more and more from the companies until they could no longer support themselves. I'm going to lump things like seniority systems in here as well: they benefit certain workers (the ones who perform less well) at the expense of the employer (who may find great difficulty acquiring competent workers for a position, and accordingly suffer from inefficiencies or worse things). Public sector unions have a special place here in my heart, because the nature of their bargaining position is different than a private-sector one. Almost without exception, a public sector union does not have to worry about accidentally driving their employer bankrupt. Instead, their ultimate failure is political: the government simply legislates a solution that the union can do nothing about. This is politically costly, however, and the unions do their best to make it as costly as possible, so the result can be utter silliness in the public sector. I believe I've been told that the Thatcher union busts were driven in part by a union demand that all children of union workers be guaranteed jobs for life.

I think that unions definitely have a very positive role to play in securing workers against abuses by employers and ensuring fair working environment, and especially have had an important role historically in developing modern workers' rights. But I feel that the game has changed and large unions' modern activities do not always properly represent those they claim to serve, and that ultimately their activities have become more of a negative influence than a positive one.

In my experience when you're living with someone intimately, having the same or similar religious beliefs is immensely important. Because I believe that deep down they will always hope for you to convert and probably thinking you will see the light someday. The atheist will also hope deep down that they will lose their faith as well. Having this kind of thinking will make it irksome for both parties in the long run. In the event of an heated argument you can bet their faith or lack of to be brought up as an innate fault within themselves.

165060,2309_A,"It is my view that the fuel efficiency of hybrid cars is an absolute myth and that this view can be supported by a very basic understanding of physics. Note that I exclude plug-in cars from this statement.

The manufacturers of hybrid cars make huge claims of offering fantastic gas milage due to their hybrid technology. Their argument is that as the car has a second electric engine, it can run around without using any gas what-so-ever at low speed and for short distances. They state that the gas engine will only kick in when the extra power is needed. This combination of gas and electric leads to the most efficient possible method to build a vehicle. I would counter this view with the following three key points:

1 - In order to function, a hybrid car must have a series of very heavy batteries, a very heavy electric motor and a series of other heavy electric components (eg systems to recover lost energy during breaking).

2 - Therefore, whenever a hybrid car is driven anywhere at any speed, on gas or electric power, it is carrying the weight of all of these components.

3 - A basic understanding of physics tells us that it is physically impossible to get more energy out of something than was put into it. 

When we combine these three points, I reach the conclusion that the fuel efficiency offered by a hybrid is a myth. I reach the conclusion that the benefits of driving around on electric power is totally offset by the extra fuel used when on gas to carry around the batteries, motor, etc which would otherwise not be there.

It is my contention that if you were to take a vehicle such as a Prius, and completely remove all of the electrical components, it would achieve a better level of fuel efficiency  over a year of driving than an identical hybrid. It is my contention that hybrid cars are developed to sell as a marketing pitch, and that in actual fact a straight up efficient gas car is a much more logical and efficient way to achieve good levels of economy.

",anyone4apint,t3_1khlm7,,,ORIGINAL_POST,5
165098,2309_A,The simplest way to understand this is to break the energy consumption of a car into two pieces: acceleration and cruise. When accelerating the weight of the car is extremely important to fuel economy. 1% more weight = 1% more energy required to accelerate. At cruise weight becomes almost negligible because the primary loss is from drag which is not effected by weight.,careydw,t1_cbp1ph1_1,1376671494.0,1.0,t3_1khlm7,5
165098,2309_A,"From the very first gas-electric hybrid the key piece of technology was regenerative braking. Suddenly instead of throwing out all the energy that was spent accelerating the car each time you have to stop you recover it and store it in a battery for later use accelerating. For most hybrids the main fuel economy gain comes from stop and go driving. On the highway, hybrids and close to identical as possible gasoline powered cars are not all that different.",careydw,t1_cbp1ph1_2,1376671494.0,1.0,t3_1khlm7,5

Assuming they have identical efficiencies they use the same amount of fuel. Now they brake and the conventional loses all that energy while the hybrid recovers 50% of it. Next time they accelerate the hybrid uses 262.5 kJ from the battery and 262.5 kJ from gasoline while the conventional uses 472.5 kJ from gasoline.",careydw,t1_cbp1ph1_3,1376671494.0,1.0,t3_1khlm7,5

166641,2329_A,"Final edit: Thanks to everyone that posted! Got alot more posts than I thought it would. I have changed my minds on some aspects of religion, if not most of them. What really made me most realize the issue is that religion isn't the main factor as to the problems I have with it. This means that people that murder for religion have more factors in play than them just being religious. I still don't like theocratic governments in any way though because I think that increases the bad taking place from religion. I guess a little religion won't hurt, even if it's not rational (in most cases).


I grew up fairly religious and went to a private school for most of my young years (pre-school-7th grade). It was a lutheran school and I followed it but not very heavily because it was boring (of course). As I got into high school I started going to a youth group called Young Life which was really fun which made me associate fun with christianity. My parents never really pushed school on me because they told me it was evil and was just to brainwash children into becoming liberals. I realized this was insane after finishing high school, unfortunately the damage was already done to my grades. I am now studying physics and have a 3.9 (compared to a 2.8 in high school) and am a leader in the classrooms.

So here is my view

After realizing how damaging religion was to me personally both mentally, physically, and socially, I have come to equate it as being damaging to everything. I see how religion has single handidly destroyed many countries and am seeing the effects it is having on America now (negative). I have yet to see any single benefit that religion gives to society and all I can see is harm. If religion was eliminated from society, the whole planet would benefit and we could actually move towards real issues (in my opinion). Change my View!

P.S. I am not asking for you to try to convince me of any religion by the way, I study science and know at least most of all religious stories are bullshit. : )

Edit: I have been convinced officially at least that religion had a place at certain times during our history. However, I still feel that if people actually looked for answers instead of assigning the questions to gods, we would have been much better off.

Edit: CriminallySane has changed my opinion that in some instances religion can be beneficial to individuals in tight knit society like certain mormon groups. I can attest to this as well because I know many mormons. It still stands however that any religion that actively searches to take over a government or destroy scientific progress is detrimental to society.

181451,2499_A,"Historically, human population growth went along with increases in food production and the switch from subsistence farming to larger scale farming and eventually industrial farming. 

These increases in food production were made possible by a string of innovations and increases in productivity through technological and methodological advances in farming, like crop rotation, better plowing tools, use of animal labour, use of manure as fertilizer, breeding of crops and livestock, chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides, and, as of late, genetic modification of crops.

Today is the first time in recorded history that we deliberately use farming methods that decrease output under the moniker of organic food production. 

I believe that the desire for organic food production is a symptom of rich and saturated societies, and is what we here know as a ""first world problem"". This desire has the potential to compromise the global food output if it becomes more wide-spread and increase the number of people living in hunger and dying from starvation.

I don't contest that chemically produced fertilizers and pesticides and GMO crops must be used carefully and in measured amounts to get the risk/benefit balance right, and yes, there are risks, hazards and dangers associated with them. I don't contest either, that early pesticides were rather poisonous and at times did more harm than good, especially when used naively.

However, science and engineering progress all the time, pesticides become better, more specific, fertilizers become better to handle, cheaper and less energy-intensive to produce, GMO crops continue what breeding programs have done in the past, that is improve a plant species for more and potentially healthier output with equal production cost.

And thus, I believe that organic food production is a dangerous fad, and that to increase food output and eradicate hunger and malnutriton we must use and improve industrial farming methods, using and improving all means available to us intelligently and wisely and without the prejudice of labelling something that came out of a chemical plant as ""bad"" while labelling something that came out of a cow's arse as somehow magically ""good"", and instead have a sane cost/benefit analysis that takes into account all that is availabe to us.

I do not understand why faith has been construed as a virtue in our society and I don't understand why others are allowed to use faith as an intellectual ""ejector seat"" from serious scrutiny or criticism. Every other claim/belief that we introduce in to society/discussion is treated with the same retort: ""what evidence do you have for this?"" And I don't understand why claims reliant on faith are treated with any seriousness.

I believe that claims based on faith, or even personal experience, should be treated with the same seriousness with which we treat claims of U.F.O sightings, or hauntings. If someone says they believe they are going to go to heaven after they die, and they believe this because God spoke to them one day, or confirmed their belief to them in some nebulous way (God saved me from hitting a small child while driving the other day and sent me a sign in the form of a radio advertisement immediately following) or an angel came to them in their dreams, I don't believe that this believer's claims should be treated with any more respect or seriousness than someone claiming they've seen Big Foot without any evidence, or a U.F.O with no clear pictures. I don't understand why saying that you have beliefs based on anything other than verifiable evidence is accepted, encouraged, and validated.

This is not to say that the believer themselves should not be respected or treated with seriousness. But if the only backing for a claim or belief is faith, then I believe that claim should be dismissed with as much ease as we dismiss other claims of the sort.

But this is exactly my point. Why should faith be regarded as a virtue if it's only purpose is to shelter the faithful from hard truths that they don't want to face? For instance, in the case of being faced with immanent death, people turn to faith to shelter them and give them hope that there will be something else than nothingness when they cease to be, but I believe courage, honesty, determination and perseverance are true virtues, and if you replaced ignorant and faithful claims at an afterlife with courageous, honest, and determined outlooks on the world as we know it to be, I believe you face the immanency of death with a healthier and more desirable outlook (both for yourself and society as a whole). It makes this life and this earth and this chance at consciousness and human solidarity and life all the more important and special. For instance, if you believe that your eternal soul will live after death forever with all the others, and *everyone* believed this, life on this earth becomes meaningless and in many ways a less desirable option. Our whole civilization could decide to toss *this* life aside and enter the eternal one, and all the sudden we have no more civilization. That is a very very bad option to me, and although it is no doubt *hugely* hypothetical and unlikely, if we regard faith as a **virtue** (something to strive toward) all we do is encourage those types of outcomes and that type of thinking.",PossumMan93,t1_caqmqja_6,1372265131.0,3.0,t1_caqlx8h,13

I have had better sex and deeper connections; I am a more confident and honest person; I have much more respect and much less resentment of women. I have also made many women very happy and saved a lot of women a whole lot of trouble (by not getting too invested in them when they don't really want me.)
This morning, a former lover (who I am still very close friends with) sent me an article about how a ""seduction guide"" was removed from kickstarter, because it contained ""misogynistic material"" that promoted ""violence towards women.""

In kickstarter's apology to the world, they cite this page from the reddit. Out of context, perhaps this might be taken to be negative--partic. the part where it says, ""Don't ask for permission. Be dominant. Force her to rebuff your advances."" Out of context, this is def. bad advice. However, the people who subscribe to the seduction subreddit are ""nice guys,"" learning how to express themselves, so it's more complicated than just bad or good.
The fact of the matter is that sexual expression is complicated and confusing for young men like me, who have been taught deference and complete respect for their whole lives. The classic advice, ""just be honest; just be yourself"" is not sufficient, and I have found pickup artist material helpful in showing me &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to be my honest self.

I'll have to begin by answering the obvious problem of critiquing the performance of teachers. Alongside this performance-based pay, would be the removal of student assessment by teachers. Typical daily assignments would be graded by the teachers, but tests would be administered and graded by a third party. This would create an unbiased view of student achievement which teachers would then be reviewed against. The better the grades students get, the more the teacher gets paid.

The current structure of teachers' performance reviews and pay is severely broken. Pay is based solely on seniority and not ability. Reviews are done by administration, and I've heard first hand that it is more to a teacher's benefit to be on good terms with the principal for a good review than it is to actually be doing a good job.

I'm tired of our schools doing an inadequate job of educating people, and teachers having no incentive to do a good job.

So, please, CMV and tell me why the status quo is an acceptable approach to education.

I have found myself unable to have meaningful conversations with many of my Jewish/Israeli or Armenian friends if we touch on either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide. I don't think the emotional hypersensitivity they express is in any way justified considering how long ago these atrocities occurred and that they have not and will not affect them personally in any way.

My issue here really is temporally focused, which is why I'm not talking about the Rwandan genocide. Most adult Rwandans today lived through the genocide and have lost loved ones that they had met and spent time with.

I've taken to referring to a victimhood complex, where basically a significant portion of one's cultural or ethnic identity is based on being a victim, and I think it's petty and tremendously counter-productive. For example, I tried having a conversation with a Jewish friend about the ""draw the holocaust"" contest that was setup by some IranCartoon and my argument was basically that you can't defend the rights of publications like Charlie Hebdo to poke fun at Islam without also having to defend IranCartoon's rights to mock the Holocaust. This quickly turned into a lecture on how my friend's family was exterminated by the Nazis. My friend would not likely have ever met the extended family members who perished under the Nazi regime, and she is not in any way under threat here in the US.

Similarly, conversations about US-Turkey relations, or Turkey's potential role in the Middle East today devolve quickly into a ""recognize the Armenian genocide!"" rant, which I think is a little more justifiable because it involves validating one's own history, but still the issue remains that such a backwards focus is, in my mind, petty and counter-productive.

I don't think people born in the 80s, 90s or 00s, people who have not lost people whom they have met and valued, people who have hardly any personal connection to such events, are at all entitled to being overly sensitive, emotional, or upset when their narratives are questioned/challenged or when their histories are attacked or trivialized.

I think that gives a good explanation of where I'm at, but I'll do my best to clarify if needed in future edits. Again, nothing here is intended to actually trivialize either the Holocaust or the Armenian genocide, or to express anything negative toward either Jews or Armenians - just addressing the reactions I've seen from young adults to certain historical topics.

There are people who still have Holocaust survivors in their families - there are people whose parents lost their entire family. Knowing that your family was exterminated because people hated them that much for being Jewish is a pretty terrible thought to grow up with as a Jew, and trauma and stress about something actually can be passed from generation to generation. Not to mention, neo-nazis and the like still exist - Jewish people all over the world are still discriminated against to large degrees, and since our worst case scenario already happened, we feel like we have to be cautious at all times and remind people that what happened was serious and had long-lasting impact that still isn't healed (there are still a lot less Jews than there were before the Holocaust, for example). In many Jewish people's eyes, even young Jews, the world has already proven to us that it wants us dead. Why wouldn't we be sensitive about one of the worst things to happen to our people while anti-semitism continues to be on the rise all over the world? I have been told personally to get in the shower, that I should be put in a concentration camp, etc just for existing as a Jewish person (who isn't even religious), so people out there are still literally wishing that the Holocaust happened to me.

Growing up and learning about the Holocaust is pretty different for Jewish people, from what I've gathered from stories I've been told by gentile friends and family (not all my family is Jewish). Certain things aren't as internalized by gentiles, and it doesn't tend to be as scary learning about what happened. It's not even something some gentiles grow up knowing about - they may be taught about it later in life, not necessarily when they're fairly young. While of course the whole world doesn't want to kill Jews, I feel like it's kind of a natural thing to feel when you've grown up with the fact that parts of your family were murdered because of this genocide that tried to take people just like you out of the world. We also have to consider that there's already some amount of sensitivity and trauma passed down from before the Holocaust - Jews in history are no strangers to ethnic cleansing, being kicked out of countries because they weren't wanted, and so on and so forth. So adding the Holocaust to that can stir up some pretty sad and strong feelings about how people feel about Jews, and lots of us can't help but feel protective and like we are being targeted even today in areas that we are relatively safe in. I do think that even though we may be aware that the whole world doesn't actually want us dead, many of us are certainly afraid that someday, that sentiment will become popular (again-ish), and personally, I can't fault anyone for fearing that.",demipearl,t1_cqlu5ff_2,1429785168.0,2.0,t1_cqlspan,16

Like, we stepped in and saved the Jews! But we never learned in my classes, for example, that the US turned away many, many Jews trying to escape the Holocaust, even though the immigration quota was nowhere near filled for most of the war. They pretty much just didn't want us and didn't care where else we went. So even though the Holocaust is pretty ingrained, there's still a lot of pieces missing from the full puzzle of shared blame.

207612,2930_B,"Where I went to school (Australia) we are taught that there are 7 continents which are as follows: North America, South America, Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and Antarctica. I believe a bit of common sense will tell you that there is in fact, 6, which would come about by combining Europe and Asia as there is an acute lack of an ocean dividing them, and should therefore be considered one and the same; Eurasia.

Most people will tell you that they are divided because of such a huge cultural divide, but I think that that argument is flawed in that many completely different cultures exist on the same continent (e.g. China and the Middle East). So if we were to choose the number of continents based on culture there would be an endless amount of completely subjective possibilities, which means that this method is irrelevant.

One might argue that if we were to ignore culture and combine Europe and Asia, we would also have to include Africa to create a super-continent, and we would have to combine North and South America to make the Americas (for arguments sake, let's forget about the Suez and Panama canals). However, I would argue that this is different as the land bridges between them are vastly smaller.

So, change my view; it makes much more sense to have 6 continents rather than 7.

EDIT: My view isn't changed, but /u/McKoijion had the most convincing argument to me. To summarise, they said that the number is just an arbitrary idea with no real meaning.

In a lot of narratives, there's an attempt - almost a strain - to concoct some kind of personal or emotional dilemma the vampire faces (e.g., a reason for them to be unhappy.)  Maybe they miss their family or the sunlight. Similarly, people actively avoid becoming a vampire, even entirely without religious motivation; it's just taken as a given that vampirism is bad.

On the whole, though, being a vampire sounds awesome.  You get some mix of (or maybe even all of) the following:

- Super strength.
- Hypnosis.
- Shape-shifting.
- Immortality.
- A very small circle of weakness:  garlic, sunlight, religious iconography.

To be sure, there are some things that would suck.  Not being able to go out during the day would be frustrating but doable and one can get acclimated.  Having to kill people to get blood would be a hurdle,  but in this day in age you could probably find easy, voluntary access to blood (see:  blood banks, weirdos on Craigs list.)  You'd have an adjustment period when everyone you know starts to die, but I *do* think you'd get used to it and it would become a minor encumbrance in contrast to a lengthy list of pros (edit:  for those of you who have read Neil Gaiman's *Sandman,* I think his portrayal of a human being thrust into immortality is probably accurate.)

Immortality in particular seems like the biggest boon.  Lifetimes to invest and make money, try new jobs, specialize in different areas, meet new people, travel, etc.  Your food source is conceivably right at your finger tips and not exactly on their toes when it comes to the vampire predator.

If revealed, you might become marginalized (as seen in True Blood) but, if I'm being completely honest, I don't know why a super fast, super strong, immortal creature would care at all about what those people think.  More over, since you literally have all the time in the world, you can wait for political change to the extent you do care.

I can see two situations where it might suck:

- You get turned a really young kid or really old adult.
- You get turned when you have just started a/are mid-family.

But these strike me as marginal.  I doubt vampires would go around changing children on purpose, and I do think people would get over their first families in the long-term, especially as they cyclically lose people in their lives.  It's possible I'm underestimating the extent to which grief can linger, but I don't think so.

I just don't see the point behind the ennui and morose for vampirism.  In the big picture, why are Bill (True Blood) and Edward (Twilight) so sad and brooding?  If the option existed, I'd almost certainly hope to become a vampire.

**EDIT:** I awarded a few deltas.  I'm not sure how much longer I'll be around (4:00 pm EST right now) but I'll try to respond to what I can when I get home later.

- A delta for /u/zevlovaci for [drawing comparisons](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq7sqqf?context=3) between specific characters' lamentations and modern day parallels (e.g., the way we complain about ""first world problems."")

- A delta for /u/DHCKris for the [""What about your soul"" argument](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq7t247?context=5), which is actually more potent than I originally realized, not being especially religious myself.

- A delta for /u/depricatedzero, who basically did a [taxonomy of vampire fiction](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/3247v7/cmv_fiction_that_portrays_vampires_as_burdened_is/cq83e18?context=3) to illustrate how the cost/benefits of being a vampire can change based upon personality and characterization.

212611,3001_A,"The Social Security Trust Fund is a set of special US Treasury bonds issued to the Social Security Administration.  

The bonds provide a convenient accounting mechanism to keep track of the dedicated tax for Social Security, but they do not provide any extra security to the system, and are not in any way ""savings"" that the government could call on to pay Social Security benefits, or for any other purpose

The fundamental reason is that the bonds are owned by the same entity who issued them.  The Social Security Administration and the US Treasury are both subsidiaries of the US Government.  The US Government just owes money to itself.

Each year, the money to pay for Social Security benefits comes from payroll taxes, and to the extent that the SSA cashes in the bonds, the various other taxes the US government charges (income tax, tariffs, etc).

Kevin Drum [wrote a piece](http://www.motherjones.com/kevin-drum/2012/12/social-security-trust-fund-is-real) on this a couple years ago that lays out the case on the other side.

&gt;Social Security surplus was invested in treasury bonds. What does that mean? It means that workers gave money to the federal government, which turned around and spent it. In return, the Social Security trust fund received bonds that represented promises to repay the money later out of the federal government's income tax receipts. In effect, it gave workers a claim on the income tax receipts of the government at a later date in time. When that time came, the federal government would have to pay up, which would make it less profitable. If the government was already running a deficit, it would make the deficit even worse.

The workers do *not* have a claim on the future tax receipts of the Federal government though.  Under US law, [there is no property interest in future Social Security payments.](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5373695872604515216)  If the US Treasury defaulted on those bonds, the only entity who could sue would be the SSA, in a case titled United States v. United States.

Indeed, Congress has plenary discretion to alter or eliminate Social Security payments, and/or forgive the debts owed to the SSA by the US Treasury.

This makes it very much unlike other debt promises.  Congress would not be able to repudiate a public bond under the 14th Amendment (or 5th Amendment).  But they can revoke Social Security any time they want.  So there is no property interest.

It's a useful accounting fiction that lets the program keep track of the dedicated tax, but it does not represent meaningful savings or anything that Americans should consider a safeguard of their retirements, because it's just one hand owing money to the other.

Edit 1:

Would be curious for any replies related to what happens when the trust fund ""runs out.""  This is the area I'm most conflicted re: the realness of the fund.

The only aspect of religion that is not covered by speech (belief and communications of that belief) or association (prayer meetings, etc) are things that are typically ruled against as being not allowed in modern society: polygamy, child abuse, stoning adulterers, preventing gay or interracial marriage, promotion of slavery, etc.

I believe that a specified ""freedom of religion"" is antithetical to the idea of separation of church and state, and should be removed in favor of strong freedoms of speech and association.

**As long as you are free to believe what you want, communicate that belief, and associate with like-minded believers, then why would you need a special addendum for religion?**

If you look at any historical case where freedom of religion was part of the trial, in every case that I've ever seen or read about, rulings in favor of the defendant were easily covered by freedom of speech and association.

I don't have anything specific against religion in general, but I am concerned about things written into a constitution that appear to be there to circumvent freedom in the guise of protecting it.

I'm open to my view being changed if you can show a situation worthy of protection in a free and democratic society where freedom of religion covers something that freedom of speech and association would not. I may be open to other criteria but I can't think of any at the moment.

**EDIT: My view has been changed** in 2 ways:

1) A ""preponderance of evidence"" situation rather than to an ""Ah Ha!"" argument. No one had a convincing single argument that by itself called for a Freedom of Religion clause, but the combination of many arguments and situations, each with merit, created an overall effect where I think we are better off having it than not having it. Basically I walked away from my desk thinking I was right, slept on it, and then realized I was wrong, though I can't put my finger on a single specific reason why - more of a holistic understanding, I guess. 

2) However, I have also come to believe that not only should there be a Freedom of Religion clause, but it should be expanded to include all truly held ethical and moral beliefs, not just those that have a religious institution standing behind them. Examples would include vegan-ism, atheism, etc. This is the exact opposite direction in which I was originally headed, but my arguments to show religion wasn't all that important by comparing it to (for example) pacifism backfired and convinced me that just because a belief in God isn't involved doesn't mean the belief doesn't matter. Although technically I could argue that my feelings against Religious Freedom have not changed because I think it should be Moral Freedom or something, it would be immature to try to claim I was still right on a technicality.

228958,3261_A,"EDIT: My view has changed!  Awesome!

Originally, I had no idea why anyone would believe in wavefunction collapse.  I thought the idea was absurd on its face.

After some discussion, I now realize that it boils down to which idea you find to be a bigger assumption:

1) True randomness (i.e. wave-function collapse)

2) The many-worlds interpretation

I still think wavefunction collapse violates Occam's razor.  But now I see that's it's because I think true randomness is more absurd than many-worlds, and I can see that people who disagree on that would feel differently about wavefunction collapse.

EDIT AGAIN: In case anyone's interested in taking the discussion further, I'll explain why I think true randomness is so bizarre.

It amounts to saying that the laws of physics dictate quantum outcomes on a case-by-case basis.

In other words, on top of the laws of gravity, magnetism, etc., there are a ton of laws that look like this:

""At 12:31:07.876 03/04/2012, particle #1244536546458 will collapse into state #547643543257.""

That's just about a worst-case scenario for Occam's razor.  It involves so many assumptions you would need *scientific notation* to count them.  It might even be an infinite number of assumptions.

When that's the alternative, I will take *any* other explanation, even if it involves parallel universes.

YET MORE EDIT: /u/sm0cc convinced me that this just depends on whether you're concerned with practical prediction-making, or the philosophical nature of reality.  At this point, I think my disagreements with modern physics have been resolved. :)

----------------------------------------------
Original post:

As I understand it, modern quantum physics claims that when a wavefunction is observed, it ""collapses"" into a single state.

I believe that, if wavefunctions did *not* collapse, we would expect to make exactly the same observations.  Thus, the idea of ""wavefunction collapse"" is unnecessary, and violates Occam's razor.

For example, let's consider the Schrodinger's Cat experiment, but with one change:  The scientist has three switches in front of them.  They flip switch #1 if they see a live cat, #2 if they see a dead cat, and #3 if they see a half-live, half-dead cat, or a zombie cat, or two cats, or anything else that's out of the ordinary.

**These three switches give us a way to tell what the scientist experiences.**  We don't have to try and interpret the wavefunction of their brain, because they will *tell* us what they experienced, using the switches.

If wavefunctions **do** collapse, we all know what happens:  They open the box, the cat collapses into either alive or dead, and the scientist flips either switch 1 or switch 2.

If the scientist repeats the experiment and tallies the results, they will (probably) end up with about half the tallies in column 1, half in column 2, and none in column 3.

Now let's consider what happens if wavefunctions **don't** collapse.

The scientist opens the box and observes the superimposed cat.  Now we have a superimposed scientist:  The wavefunction is a superimposed version of a scientist observing a live cat, who flips switch #1, and a scientist observing a dead cat, who flips switch #2.

But here's the thing:  **Switch #3 remains unflipped**.  It is not superimposed, it is simply *off*, because no part of the wavefunction corresponded to a scientist flipping it.

From this, we can conclude that the scientist did not experience anything out of the ordinary - remember, if they did, they would have flipped switch #3.

We can even imagine repeating the experiment, and the wavefunction will become many superimposed versions of the scientist, observing every possible outcome.  Most of these outcomes have roughly half the tallies in column 1 and half in column 2, but none have any tallies in column 3.

So, if we are the scientist, and wavefunctions don't collapse, we should expect to observe a live cat about half the time, and a dead one the other half.  

Which is exactly what we expected if wavefunctions **do** collapse.

So why should we postulate that wavefunctions collapse?  It wouldn't change what we expect to observe, so there is no possible way to gather evidence for it.

229432,3274_A,"There was that John Bellushi post about how he actively undermined women writers because he thought they weren't funny. Guy was a huge dick - that's clear,  but the underlying question of, ""Are women as funny as men?"" is what I'm getting at. What zero people in that thread were discussing, of course, was any actual reasons why this might be the case... Here's what I think. Change my view... 

To put it short, I think that in addition to using humor to appeal to one's own gender, guys have to develop an ability to make women laugh in order to get laid. Women don't typically need to rely on this as much, and so their senses of humor usually stay focused on their own gender. The result of this, of course, is that men develop humor or routines that appeal to broader audiences, and therefore become more successful comedians.

We could look at a similar phenomena of getting implants. Both men and women get implants for various reasons, but the primary reason is to look good to appeal to the opposite sex. Far more women get implants than men because men are visually-focused on looks. Still, some men get implants on their calves or butt or whatever, but it's far less frequent because the added benefits of attractiveness aren't as high as they are when women get implants.

My hypothesis on the subject is that men are typically ""funnier"" than women because women find humor to be a more attractive attribute than men find it to be - in general, of course. This leads more men to appeal to both sexes, which leads them to be more successful comedians. 


**EDIT** Okay, my view has changed only slightly. No one has put forth a more convincing argument as to why less women are in comedy. There have been some links to studies (which were great, thank you) that showed that men were only marginally (2.2%) funnier than women at writing captions, but that both genders seems to greatly attribute the authorship of these funny captions to men. 


**After all this, here's my view...**
My working hypothesis at the moment is that men develop the ability to create and deliver humor more than women because they spend more time trying to impress using humor. However, women, being on the receiving end of the humor have a more broad sense of humor than guys, with men usually only on the receiving end of other male humor. This explains the discrepancy of women on the delivery-side of comedy, and also why on the receiving-side, women tend to find everyone funny, but men tend to only find other men funny. 

I do agree that there is some feedback from 'society' which helps to reinforce these roles, but I think the causal aspect of the difference in comedy careers as well as why these roles are perpetuated in society are because of the differences in how humor is used to attract males vs. females.

You cannot get your hand inside them to apply pressure to certain stains, and even if you could, you still can't apply the pressure needed to clean some stains without risking breaking the glass. Furthermore, the stem of the glass is also brittle and serves no practical purpose. For these reasons, wine glasses should not be used or be expected to be used.

&gt;Religion is an insult to human dignity. With or without it you would have good people doing good things and evil people doing evil things. But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

I've seen people use this quote many times. To me, it's inflammatory anti-religious nonsense. I'm interested to see the other perspective. Have I misunderstood his quote? Is there something about human nature that I've misunderstood?

First of all, I recognize that religion can cause good people to do bad things. It has done it many times and it will continue to do so. ISIS is the most obvious example right now, but there are countless other examples as well.

What I can't understand is the last sentence:

&gt;But for good people to do evil things, that takes religion.

He seems to be saying that **only religion** can cause good people to do bad things. This seems like total nonsense to me. TONS of things can cause good people to do bad things.

For example, soldiers who commit war crimes sometimes do so because they were ""just following orders,"" out of a sense of patriotism, or in order to protect their families.

Poverty can make good people do evil things. 

Drugs can, too. They can temporarily taking away people's sanity, which causes them to do stupid things. Or drug addictions can drive people to such financial desperation that they're willing to do evil things to get their next hit.

---

Let me explain what I understand by ""good people"" and ""evil things."" Perhaps I haven't properly understood what Weinberg meant by these words?

A ""good person"" is someone who wouldn't normally do an evil thing without the influence of some outside force. In the case of this quote, the ""outside force"" is religion.

An ""evil thing"" is anything that society generally sees as extremely bad, such as murder. 

In order to CMV, please:

* convince me that religion is the only thing that can cause good people to do evil things.
* show me that I could've misunderstood Weinberg.
* show me that my definitions of ""good person"" or ""evil thing"" are wrong (in the context of Weinberg's quote, of course).
* anything else that shows that anything I've said is wrong.

Many amendments are written in unusual english by todays standards, making it difficult to tease out meaning. Many other amendments overlap in meaning and could be combined to simplify them while also covering more people. The fact is, it is outdated.

I believe it should be revised every 100 years or so because culture and language are organic. They change based on technology, public conscious, and international relations. Should we follow the advice of a group who believed slavery was acceptable? That thought only white, male, property owners should/could vote? Can you read through the document and understand what was meant or does much of it come across as confusing to todays readers? The world has changed and I believe we need to change with it in order to be relevant. I also believe our ideas and views from today will experience the same degradation over time. In 100 years will the world still care about gun rights? Will the population still speak mostly english or will we add more spanish to our vocabulary? Will words like gay hold the same meaning as it does now or will it return to the usage it once had? We cannot know. We should not force our ideas through time, expecially when future generations will have the same issues understanding us as we do understanding the founding fathers.

What I can't understand is why we are clinging to the past, to a group who would likely be viewed as backward racists today. We should take what we believe now and govern by those beliefs. We should update, revise, and examine our core ideas from time to time to at least make sure we still understand what they are. I am not talking about simply throwing the constitution out either. I am saying we should interpret it for today, update it, and use our revised version instead. Then both can be looked at by the next generation and adjusted as needed. It should update and change with the citizenry and the times while still being the timeless core of our laws. It would take a lot of work, a lot would change, but I believe we would be better for it.

---Edit---
Many responses seem to think I am saying scrap the whole thing and start over. No, I am saying we need an updated, reworded one that uses the meanings as we take them today. All men are equal shoule read all persons, prohibition and its repeal should just be removed, the 15th and 19th should be combined and all inclusive with restrictions put in after the fact. Those are examples of what I mean but not the whole of it.

To CMV you need to show me that having an old, poorly worded document is better than a revision of it in modern terms. It would be hard to do but it would be better for the nation and easier to work with than if we left it be. CMV

I think it started at my current job, where occasionally I was told to scrape websites and collect leads for the marketers (which is probably me favorite part of the job). It feels really fulfilling to me to make something (a bot) that does what a person couldn't do in a month's full time work. That, and it feels rewarding knowing I gathered something(s) with immediate marketable value. That, and that, and the idea of all of the potential uses and benefits to having this information. 

I've been to a lot of hackathons (programming-marathons) and open-data is an awesome opportunity to make something cool and resume-building quickly (hackathons are usually only 24-48 hours overnight). The more data out there, the more possibilities there are to help the public or invent something novel.  

I think of the government the same way, if the data they collect and use helps their ability to govern then I am all for it.  

And on a personal level, I don't care that whoever is tracking my phone, reading my emails, whatever. I'm just glad someone is using my information to make my life and the lives of others to be better.  

Edit: you guys got me  
-If the NSA collected less information, it could be more useful and usable.    
-Your Emails, much like music or physical letters, *should* be your own private property, even if they aren't now  
-I can't both agree that the NSA should collect this information and the NSA should do this legally, because they are collecting it illegally it is a logical fallacy  
-By agree to this, I take away other people's privacy rights, and that's not okay  
-There could be new data or ways of analyzing it that would more seriously violate privacy or give power, and this is setting a bad precedent  
-Mass surveillance is bad historically

This perception is incorrect but is still commonplace. I believe that the Bush years will be viewed similarly by future generations for the following reasons:

The much disputed election in Florida was a huge challenge to the world's second-largest democracy. Having the Supreme Court effectively appoint a president upon party lines significantly hurt faith in the US political process and led to the polarization that has led to the Do-Nothing Congresses of 2006-2008 and 2010-.

Bush's decision to go to war in Iraq eroded the brief period of global consensus that saw countries from Iran to Russia united in sympathy with the USA against Al-Qaeda. I'm not saying we would be at world peace thereafter, but we could have taken advantage of that unity to seriously reduce international conflict.

Climate change. Need I say more? The Bush years saw inaction on global climate change that has endangered every country on earth.

Imperialism. The expansion of the War on Terror to Iraq and other groups was correlated with a rise of police militarization (in the US) and espionage (globally) and led to the installation of treasonous quisling governments around Europe.

Economic instability. The 2008 housing bubble (heavily concentrated in, you guessed it, Florida) triggered a global financial crisis that the world has yet to recover from. The progress that the world's 99%, overwhelmingly located in developing countries like China and India, made during the 2000s has almost completely been [reversed](http://blogs-images.forbes.com/timworstall/files/2015/01/oxfam1.jpg) by this fucking crisis. Global equity markets are now [as US-centric](http://www.marketwatch.com/story/heres-the-map-of-the-world-if-size-was-determined-by-market-cap-2015-08-12) as they've ever been since at least the Eighties, meaning that ""the rise of the rest"" has been an utter illusion.

Erosion in quality of living. In addition to the phony ""development"" of countries like China and India, Western countries have seen a large absolute drop in well-being due to the financial crisis of the Bush years, a drop which treaties like TPP and TTIP may well enshrine into law.

TL;DR: If the world is a dystopia in 2200, George W. Bush will be (rightfully or not) blamed.

Yes, I think the Supremes blew it.  But it was in some ways a testament to our democracy that everyone accepted the process.  The peaceful transition of power, particularly in an unsatisfying way (and whichever way it went, half the country was going to be unsatisfied) is still relatively rare in the world.

My friend argued back that since both of us are white, we can never understand the situation and the anger these representatives of BLM feel. Therefore, she argued, we cannot criticize their actions since we cannot and can never understand their perspective.

My friend showed me [this article](http://time.com/3605606/ferguson-in-defense-of-rioting/) in defense of her argument. I'll quote from the conclusion,

&gt;Instead of tearing down other human beings who are acting upon decades of pent-up anger at a system decidedly against them, a system that has told them they are less than human for years, we ought to be reaching out to help them regain the humanity they lost, not when a few set fire to the buildings in Ferguson, but when they were born the wrong color in the post-racial America.

In response to the article, I essentially argued that while I do feel for minorities in the U.S, violence is neither a morally sound or pragmatic way to go about change. I also felt that the argument presented (we are not minorities, therefore we will never be able to understand, therefore we cannot criticize) is fundamentally unsound.

I'd love to hear some support for her viewpoint, because I am an open-minded person and I care about racial equality America

* The animals - especially endangered ones - can be cared for, either to preserve the species or ultimately release into the wild. If we're using the usual justification of animal rights - they can feel pain/have a life - then letting them lead a safe and happy life in captivity seems to be more moral than the dangers of the wild.

* This is a less quantifiable good, but zoos let citizens see animals which they otherwise not, leading them to consider them - and the environment - when creating/voting on policies.

While I guess the best way to C my V would be to provide overwhelming evidence that zoos provide lower quality of life for the animals than life in the wild and that there are more effective means of conserving/promoting endanger species, I'm mostly interested in values/premises I haven't considered. 

Change my view! :)

THe trouble is, every last bit of news I hear about the current Middle East conflicts goes only to reinforce my ever-growing belief that the Kurds are the only group involved with any moral high ground.

1) The Kurds espouse a number of western values that are largely absent in the region.

Only The Kurds and the (middle and lower class) Iranians show any tendency to respect women's rights or treat them as equals deserving of respect or status.  The Kurds have women in their military, and even their conservative tribal organizations can have Matriarchs in charge of political and military decisions.

2) They care about more than just themselves.

The Kurds have gone out of their way, at significant danger to themselves, to rescue other ethnic minorities in the region, including famously the Yazidis, who everyone else was more than happy to let ISIS literally murder, enslave, and rape at genocidal scales.

3) Their political opponents have all shown themselves to be monsters in the fullness of time.

Turkey is key here.  For a while Turkey managed to keep up quite a reputation as a modern secular-Islamic state.  Now they're wringing their hands about how *powerless* they are to stop ISIS while they gleefully watch the black banner do all their dirty work for them, then step in with overwhelming force to rescue Ataturk's grave the moment it's threatened.  They're bombing Kurdish targets *right now* while crying about ISIS.  I would want independence from them too.

**Things that will not convince me:**

1) A Kurd did something bad once.

Every group consists of a bulk center and extremes on either end.  It takes a pattern of ideological violence to establish that a group is responsible collectively.  I need to be shown that the Kurds, as a national or cultural entity, are at least half as bad as their neighbors in terms of the actions they will routinely, officially, or systemically commit or tolerate.

2) It is advantageous to ally ourselves with monsters.

Look, you can be totally right about this.  I won't even argue that this isn't possible, and might even agree with you, but it does not change my view about what we, the west, *should* be doing.


Make me a cynic again, please.

*The USA is the only nation in the history of humanity to actually use atomic weapons against an enemy. From past experience alone it is the country most likely to use them again.

*The main positive effect of atomic weapons, that gets brought up a lot , is mutually assured destruction. The USA dropped 2 atomic bombs, not as retribution to an atomic attack. It demonstrated a lower bar for considering using them.

*The USA regularly starts new wars. It's certainly the nation among the big superpowers that is most likely to initiate a new war and, in the case of Irak, can not even explain why they went to war in the first place. A country that is this likely to be involved in wars is more likely to find itself in a position where it would consider using another atomic bomb.

Many comments so far have pointed out that even if all of this were true, it would not constitute a police state. I'm willing to give quite a bit of ground on that phrase, as I likely used it without thinking it through.

Edit 2: I'm sorry some people think I'm a shill. I'm just a concerned guy trying to help.

First Amendment

Cops can tell you what to say, taze you for arguing with them, arrest journalists, and arrest you for filming them. They can break up peaceful protests by force. They bring assault weapons to memorial services and gay rights marches and anti-war demonstrations.

[Here](http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/tag/journalist-arrested) are some stories about arrests of journalists.

Second Amendment

Most states don't seem to have tried to take your guns away, but that won't stop them from arming the police with military weapons. If the police attack you, where can you go for help? Why are the (civilian) police forces authorized to carry weapons which are illegal in the states they police? Do police really get into gunfights with heavily armed drug dealers and save the lives of crowds of law abiding citizens, like something out of a 1980's cop thriller?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militarization_of_police) is the wiki about police militarization.

Fourth Amendment

Cops can seize your property without cause or warrant (civil forfeiture), and search your car, phone, or house without cause or warrant. Don't believe me? Look it up. Multiple recent court decisions defend an officer's wish to do whatever he wants with your things.

[Here](http://www.mintpressnews.com/supreme-court-rules-police-do-not-need-a-warrant-to-search-your-home/206199/) is an article about the most recent supreme court decision on searches.

[This](https://www.google.com/search?newwindow=1&amp;rlz=1C1ASUC_enUS632US632&amp;es_sm=93&amp;q=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;oq=police+raid+the+wrong+house&amp;gs_l=serp.3..0j0i22i30l9.269565.274940.0.275095.27.25.0.0.0.0.299.3358.0j18j2.20.0....0...1c.1.64.serp..7.20.3353.s4Q1aX2iVQY) is just a google page, but how many of these wrong house, no knock searches are too many?

[Here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_forfeiture_in_the_United_States) is the wiki about civil forfeiture.

It appears the court has ruled that police -do- need a warrant to search your cell phone.

Fifth Amendment

Cops can arrest you on the spot for literally anything they see fit, and you will be held -at least- until your bail hearing, and you will be lucky if you can afford your bail. Also, they can compel you through whatever means they see fit (lying, threatening, depriving of basic needs, torture) to bear testimony against yourself, even if you are innocent (any testimony given under duress is admissible to the court, and usually leads to conviction regardless of proof-of-guilt). Also, they fund their own departments by issuing citations and stealing property (seriously, if you haven't looked up civil forfeiture, do it now).

[Here](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1656) is a good video where a Virginia Beach officer explains criminal 'interviews.' If you have time to really watch this, please listen to what he says, and how he says it. His job is to look for wrongdoing, and he freely admits that if he wants to pull someone over, he can follow them until they do something he can pull them over for. [This](https://youtu.be/6wXkI4t7nuc?t=1881) is where he starts to describe interrogation specifically.

Sixth Amendment

You can be kept in jail for years before you are brought before a judge, and can expect no help or information from the prison guards. Guards are there to keep people in, not to save lives. Numerous cases are rising to the public view regarding prison conditions, and maybe we should start throwing the 'cruel and unusual' term around. Either way, in 2011, about 3 people died in American jails -every day- with countless others tortured or left off the books (think Chicago's interrogation fiasco this year, or Guantanamo).

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/24/chicago-police-detain-americans-black-site) is an article about Chicago's secret prison.

[Here](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2014/09/08/how-many-police-shootings-a-year-no-one-knows/) is an article about police killings. Note the fact that they aren't even tracked very carefully.

[Here](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/27/deaths-in-jails-885-inmates) is an article about deaths in prisons. Again, information is out of date, and possibly inaccurate.

Eighth Amendment

Some Judges set reasonable bail, others do not. Some of the Judges caught setting unreasonable bail are called out, or disciplined, most are not. Chances are very good you will not be able to afford bail if you go inside. Think about that next time you're tempted to flip off a police officer.

I'm having a hard time finding specifics about the time between an arrest and a bail hearing, but pages I visit says it varies state by state, with multiple lawyers giving anecdotes of people waiting up to a year in jail before being -acquitted- because they couldn't make bail. Personally, I have known more than one person to spend months in jail after being unable to afford bail. Whether or not someone is found guilty, shouldn't this be viewed as a violation of our right to a speedy trial? Not sure about that one.

[Here](http://www.bjs.gov/content/dcf/ptrpa.cfm) are some statistics on drug bail.

[Here](http://www.justicepolicy.org/uploads/justicepolicy/documents/bailfail_executive_summary.pdf) is a document full of prison statistics, most relevantly, bail rates.

Bottom line:

You don't have rights anymore. Each of the constitutional rights we have were set forth by Americans to protect their families from overzealous government officials. These rights are not there to protect you from your neighbors. They aren't there to protect you from your employer. They were written specifically to protect you from the Government, and they have failed. Remember your history, read the constitution. Every one of the rights Americans hold dear is being violated by police, judges, and politicians every day. Every Day. EVERY DAY. Every bullshit arrest, every bullshit sentence, every bullshit traffic stop, every bullshit roadside search. If you try to exercise your right to free speech, you can be stopped for it. If you argue with the officer, he will pull you out of the car for an arrest and search without warrant. If you resist him in any way, or if you can't hear him, or if you step on the brake pedal by mistake, or if you just don't fall on your face quickly enough, he will shoot you. Those are the facts.

Every year, another generation of high-school students reads 1984, by Orwell. They tell us what to buy, and at what price (medicine, insurance). They tell us our wars are moral, or economically sound. They tell us who to love (media, soldiers, 'heros'). They tell us who to hate (war, media, socialists, WBC). We are in a constant state of war on at least one front (Germany, Vietnam, Korea, Iran, Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria, Egypt, Russia, Mexico, and God only knows where else). They lie to us, and suppress anyone looking for the truth (media, arrest of journalists, denying the right to assemble or film officers). They tell us what to believe. They tell us how to behave. They will kill you if you do not fall in line exactly when and how they tell you.

It might not look like you live in a police state. After all, you can drive to work, do your job, buy your groceries, and go on vacation. However, if a police officer, a judge, or anyone else has the authority to ignore the Constitution of the United States of America, what else can you call it? Do I need to dare you to piss off a cop? If you know what will happen when you piss off a cop, how can you accept that? Why are police even authorized to use deadly force? You really want them to kill someone for speeding? Well what about stealing your car, can we kill them then? How many lives are saved through the use of deadly force? Is it worth it?

Well it isn't worth it to me. I'm going to keep my head down until I can afford to get the Hell out of here. I'd rather Live as a citizen of the World than Die as a citizen of this country.

If you think the constitution protects you (at all), think again. They are walking all over your rights, and you aren't going to notice until they arrest you, or kill your children. If they never do, you will live your life among the sheeple, waiting for the law to tell you how to live.

I'm sorry if this comes across as somewhat belligerent, but I believe the seriousness of the situation in this country isn't exactly sinking in for the general public. Am I wrong? Is it already getting better? Are citizens safer than they used to be? Is my information wrong or biased? I would love a discussion about what we are doing right, what we are doing wrong, and what we can do next.

I see no evidence of this being abused on a scale that would even sniff at the possibility of the US being considered a police state by any definition.

Civil forfeiture does require cause and a hearing in court. There are well recognized exceptions to the warrant requirement and if anything, court decisions are breaking against the state.

Police officers are only legally authorized to execute an arrest if there has been a warrant issued or they have reasonable suspicion that a crime has been committed and this person committed it. The bail hearing, or arraignment, typically happens within 24-48 hours of the arrest. The judge will hear about the facts and circumstances surrounding the arrest and has the power to set the defendant free if the state cannot produce sufficient evidence justifying the arrest. Then, this addresses your next section as well, sets bail. If bail is unreasonably high for the defendant, it can be reduced and commonly is. Judges don't want to keep people locked up if they don't have to, at least for the most part. State judges are elected officials after all. The bottom line is that cops and prosecutors don't have the time or resources to make bad arrests or bring bad cases to a jury. That's why most arrests are the result of a long investigative process where the evidence is in place and a judge signs an arrest warrant. Cops making an arrest on the street is usually because the crime happens right in front of them or several people tell them person A was running from the store that was just robbed.",eye_patch_willy,t1_ct431zw_4,1436968899.0,19.0,t3_3ddcu5,8

Yes, this year, 2015, has featured several national news stories involving allegations of police misconduct that resulted in people dying. They are all tragedies and I hope that police departments across the country learn from the mistakes made in those situations. What almost never gets reported is the boring, routine, everyday police work that accounts for 99% of the police/public interactions. Such stories don't sell. Yes there is abuse in the system.

263824,3814_B,"First, I know ""egalitarian"" is a long word, a lot of people don't know what it means, and it doesn't have the history nor the recognition that the word ""feminism"" has, but I feel like it's time for a change. 

The internet has caused a lot of voices that may otherwise be drowned out come to the forefront, such as the feminist extremists (or ""feminazis"" if you will). It seems that because of this many people are being turned off by the idea of feminism (myself included) because they associate that word with the people that blame all of life's problems on the patriarchy. 

My friends are starting to joke about feminism and I see more people mocking it every day. I believe it is due to the extremists, and how polarizing and antagonistic a lot of their views are. This stubbornness to stick to the name is causing a lot of people to dismiss, or even despise, the movement and is hurting it's support. I feel that if true feminists were willing to distance themselves from the ""feminazis"" it would stop a lot of animosity people have towards them. 

This might end up being as simple as calling it something different, because maybe the only ones that would keep the term ""feminism"" would be the extremists. They might want to retain the name so as to not give in or lose the fight. Of course there is no way of telling, and they may very well go along with the ""true feminists"" and call themselves egalitarian anyways. 

In either case, I feel like it would be beneficial to cause a clear divide between feminists and feminazis in order to garner more support and to have feminist ideas to be taken more seriously.

It's also worth pointing out that the ""feminazis"" (god, I hate that term) often have something resembling a point. I'm no fan of the Gawker-network callout culture that's become somewhat of a normalized force in internet discussions today, but I think that most of the internet's disdain of feminism comes from a caricatural portrayal brought about by cherry-picking examples of poorly-manifested attempts at feminism. I think it's valuable, next time you see a ""feminazi"" post, to look carefully at the source material and realize that, however acerbic or acidic the post might be, the author's coming from a legitimate place of pain much of the time, a place which unfortunately informs the tone of the piece.",n_5,t1_ct3p6ns_1,1436929944.0,16.0,t3_3dbole,5

And by ""socially-sanctioned,"" I mean a definition broadly acceptable to the PC mainstream, such that you could print it in the OpEd section of the NYT without major media or social-media backlash.

The [OED definitions](http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/definition/american_english/female), while coherent, are trans-exclusionary and therefore not socially sanctioned:

&gt;**female** *(adjective)*  Of or denoting the sex that can bear offspring or produce eggs, distinguished biologically by the production of gametes (ova) that can be fertilized by male gametes.

So maybe there's a socially-sanctioned definition of ""male"" or ""female"" which doesn't reference anatomy?  If you can think of one, you may CMV. 

Citing studies less compelling/conclusive than mythologized by redditors, you might respond that ""male"" and ""female"" refer to the innate biology of the brain, not the body.  But the studies you're thinking of identify general trends, not clear markers of a ""male brain"" vs. ""female brain.""  It would be like talking about a ""male height"" vs. ""female height.""  Not a very coherent concept.

Gender, which is what you seem to be concerned with, is based on internal awareness, and much harder to pin down.

This is not your fault, as you didn't choose to be a white male, but the 20 people who are in the front running for the other scholarships didn't choose that either, and I'm sure if the system was fair, they would be advocating for the elimination of special requirement scholarships, but the fact of the matter is the system isn't fair.",[deleted],t1_csvipb5_1,1436311416.0,3.0,t3_3ch5ru,6

270976,3911_B,"I'm sure we've all seen and heard of police officers who were aggressive and violent while on duty, but much less frequently do we hear of officers who have friendly interactions with civilians when there is no clear or present danger present. I've seen a few videos on the internet of cops dancing at block parties or playing a short round of cards in a park but none have gone viral like [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hl972jf8cs4) of an NYPD officer dancing at the NYC LGBT pride parade this past weekend. The general consensus is polarized; some people like myself are perfectly fine, even happy, that some officers are finding enjoyment and positive interactions with civilians in their day-to-day work rather than hostility and aggression; others feel that this interaction was completely unprofessional and that the officer should be fired or at least punished.

I believe that the officer shouldn't face any punishment for simply dancing with a civilian for less than 20 seconds at a parade with clearly no imminent threat or danger present. My logic behind this is that many officers won't be punished for using excessive force or even wrongfully killing someone, so why should an officer be punished for taking 20 seconds to dance with a friendly civilian at a parade. Even if we lived in a world where excessively violent officers were rightfully punished, I would still be angry if this cop were to be punished for dancing at a parade.

272024,3920_B,"A few months back there was a tragic case where a poor young girl accidentally shot a Superviser at a gunrange. The girl was nine year old and firing a Uzi submachine gun on full automatic.

From some comments various people have left on this and the reporting it seems that it is not unusual for kids even younger then that to shoot real firearms.

This is ridiculous. Children (and I define that in this case as everyone under 18) are not nearly responsible enough to handle them. There is a reason we do not let little children drive cars or drink alcohol etc.

Childrens Brains (and even young adult's, but you have to draw the line somewhere) are still in the process of developing. We all have done stupid shit as children. Hell, just here on reddit I read about some guy who shot his brother *twice* as a kid. You may choose not be believe that story, but for me it seems plausible.

I know btw that the Instructor in this case made some critical mistakes as well, and that children shooting firearms have to be supervised. But still, if the Girl had the experiance, wisdom and patience that comes with being an adult, this would have never happened. 

An adult acts as another layer of protection to prevent an accident. In my view, having a child handle a firearm is a little like not exercising proper trigger discipline. If you do everything else right, nothing bad can really happen. But you should never rely on doing everything else right.

You might know some very mature and patient 14 year old who is really interested in hunting or sport shooting. In that case, congratulations. But I still stand by my view that that kid should wait and grow four more years. Sure, they might not get to shoot for four your years, but nobody will die.

/u/caw81 has slightly changed my view. Now I think only people under the age of 16 should be barred.

However, any arguments I would normally use against allowing incestuous marriage have been declared void. For example, you can't simply say it's disgusting, because a lot of people find homosexuality disgusting, and society has decided that people's rights shouldn't be inhibited by the disgust of others. Incestuous couples are more likely to have deformed children, but marriage is not about reproduction. Maybe there's some psychological affliction behind it, but homosexuality used to be classified as a disorder as well, but psychologists realized the error of their ways as it became socially acceptable. Of course, any religious objections are right out.

So with the last defenses against gay marriage dismantled, I'm left without any good reason why siblings should marry each other. CMV

272750,3930_A,"&gt; marriage is not about reproduction.
This is true, and I'll grant that a key component of the recent ruling was that marriage cannot be distinguished based on a couple's ability to have, or preference for, children. So, in that sense, I understand why you want to dismiss that factor altogether. However, there's a substantial line between a homosexual couple and an incestuous heterosexual one: the former can have sex or not have sex, but no matter what, their sexual lives will not impact the lives of anyone else; the latter, however, will result in a significantly higher chance of producing a child with a lower quality-of-life. True, marriage does not equal procreation, but by sanctioning that relationship, the government would be supporting a relationship that may negatively impact the lives of their future offspring.",tit_wrangler,t1_cskrtjj_1,1435439790.0,2.0,t3_3bbxyv,3
272750,3930_A,"I imagine a common argument to this might be that we allow marriage for individuals who knowingly have a higher genetic chance of passing on an abnormal trait, but we cannot simply disallow marriage entirely for one person. Similarly, it's wrong to ban marriage of an entire sexual orientation. People have the right to fall in love and get married. However, that is not the same as banning the marriage of an incestuous couple, as those individuals can still fall in love within their desired orientation, outside of the family, and get married in a relationship that will statistically produce healthier children.",tit_wrangler,t1_cskrtjj_2,1435439790.0,2.0,t3_3bbxyv,3
274157,3955_A,"I would like to preface this by saying that this view does not come from a place of homophobia or ignorance. I am very understanding and accepting of the LGBT community. I have several gay friends and I am very informed about LGBT issues including transgenderism. I believe that conflicts of gender/identity/orientation etc. are innate and not a choice. 

I hold this belief because I feel as though this world will never be fully accepting of the LGBT community. It saddens me to see the statistics of [depression and suicide](http://www.healthline.com/health/depression/gay#1) amongst youth in this group of people. LGBT kids are nearly 4x more likely to be depressed and suicidal than straight peers. The majority are bullied in school as well. Many of these people don't want to come out and have to live with this secret. Many of these people do come out and they are rejected. I understand that the world is a beautiful place because there are so many types of people. I also believe that we should make every effort to accept, love, and tolerate each other. However, we are only making these strides because people have always been and will always be born gay/bi/transgender etc. If this was not possible then this issue would never occur. Also, I am aware that many people in the LGBT community are proud to be gay. However, I can't help but feel as though they are embracing it because they have no other choice. I feel as though most (if not all) of these people must have had at least one dark moment where they felt different and wanted to be like everyone else.

I would like to add that I am not supporting eugenics. I do not want to prohibit people who would be born with the gay gene from being born at all. I just want to remove the possibility of the person acquiring that gene. Furthermore, I do not wish to modify every single gene to make the perfect human beings. I am only speaking about this issue. Also, I would only encourage this if it could be done safely and would have no major side effects.

Edit: My view has been changed and I am done replying. 80% of the counter-arguments were just bashing eugenics and that hardly changed my view at all. Look at the comment by /u/Miguelinileugim for a well-thought, original point.

The atoms are created in a lab, usually by slamming two other heavy atoms together in a collider. The resulting atom decays in microseconds and does not naturally occur outside the lab.

Calling these things new elements strikes me as the same thing as grabbing two random objects, (say a water bottle and a book), holding them together in your hands and saying, ""Look! I've created a bookbottle!""

The object will only last until you let go of it, and then be torn apart by the stronger force, in this case, gravity. It's not a new tool or object and you can't file a patent for it.

Ununpentium and its ilk are not elements if they can't be found outside the lab, cannot exist as more than a few atoms at a time, or last more than a few microseconds. They are interesting experiments to be sure, but they are not new elements.

Where it is synthesized doesn't matter. The lab is still in the universe, so it could be said that the universe is creating these atoms.

Inspired a little bit from responding to [this post here](http://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/comments/37131i/cmv_when_captured_and_convicted_swat_pranksters/), I think as a society we should really start thinking of imprisonment and announcing sentences in terms of days, not years. In terms of using sentences as a means of discouraging crime, the number 5 sounds small, but 5 years is actually 1826 days (including a leap year), which is a massive number. When you start talking about locking someone away for decades, and you realize actually the thousands and thousands of days you're taking away from person, and if that punishment really does match the severity of the crime... I don't think people actually have the capacity to imagine being sat in a small barred room day after day for that long. They just hear 7 years and think ""Oh it's only 7"", and fail to recognize just how much of someone's life is actually being taken away.

Numbers in the thousands are too big for us to really feel and conceptualize. We will detach ourselves because it is impossible to imagine a thousand days of suffering all at once. Thus we will begin the desensitization process and this will probably end up having little effect on sentences.",celeritas365,t1_crit0oa_1,1432424479.0,23.0,t3_3717y2,8
286863,4150_B,"That's a fair point, and something I had considered, and I do understand that at a certain point we cannot simply fathom such great numbers or lengths of time. To picture thousands of people you're really having to compare it to stadiums you've been to, etc... and to think back years and years it all seems to rush by in a blur... but in the moment, sitting bored and alone for hours, let alone days, I think people can empathize with that. And it seems to me it's much better to have a number so large that people can't imagine how you'd manage that long being trapped so, that having a number so small people can comprehend it and comprehend it as tiny.

286864,4150_B,"In many ways though years emotionally resonate with people. 5 years is 5 birthdays, 20 changes of the seasons, 5 Christmases. Long years in prison sounds more powerful than a very many long days in prison. Plus, at least at first, people will hedge the big numbers, thinking ""Oh that is only so high because it is in days.""  Without formally converting it out. Taking 5 years from someone is also about more than just the 5 years time. It tuns 45 year olds into 50 year olds. What I am getting at is that losing a year means a lot when looking at lives as a whole. When you hear numbers in days it is harder to imagine the percentage of your life gone and all of the important things you'll miss. ",celeritas365,t1_critdbv,1432425224.0,4.0,t1_crit47i,8
286865,4150_B,"Perhaps then your response really goes back more to what /u/Qwerkss  is saying, that it really isn't the number so much as it is the lack of empathy. I suppose part of why I was saying days would be better is because I can personally see myself empathizing more trying to imagine the scale of so many hundreds or thousands of days than I can with a small number of years. A bigger number of days to me is better than the way that retrospective compresses years into just a series of a few dozen pinnacle moments. ",IIIBlackhartIII,t1_crithmb,1432425486.0,1.0,t1_critdbv,8
286866,4150_B,"You are right, I did kind of take a detour from my original argument. I will combine the two. For many people (not everyone) large numbers will be too big to have meaning and small numbers are easier for people to wrap their heads around. If I told you how hot it was in kelvin, the number would be very large but it wouldn't mean anything to you. You would instantly convert it to Celsius or Fahrenheit. Hearing numbers too large to be comprehended isn't better than having numbers that people can comprehend as tiny. Those large numbers don't have ever so slightly more meaning than the largest comprehensible number, to many they have less meaning. Stalin (who I think was a terrible person for the record) said (although I just discovered this quote is likely wrongly attributed to him), ""A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."" I personally believe this quote is true. I can imagine one death, empathize with one death, I can feel as if I have lost a loved one. If I hear of a million deaths I cannot make myself feel grief. I don't have that many loved ones to lose. My inability to grasp the magnitude of that pain actually makes me feel less empathetic pain than I would have if I was only being informed of one death. Sometimes smaller numbers can have a bigger impact.",celeritas365,t1_critsbb_1,1432426146.0,2.0,t1_crithmb,8

286867,4150_B,"∆ I guess we all understand numbers differently, but ultimately I think it really is lack of empathy more than interpretation of numbers directly. I personally could empathize more, but perhaps it's not just the days but also considering the age of someone as they're getting out, how much of their lives was taken, and how different a person they might be.
